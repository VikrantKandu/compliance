    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      by default reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access permissions.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, enable "Block all public access"
      in the S3 settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to specific users or roles.
