    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users but rather to groups or roles. Direct attachment to users can
      lead to complex permission management and potential security risks.
    Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to users can lead to inconsistent permissions
      and make it difficult to manage and audit access controls. By attaching policies
      to groups or roles, you promote better security practices and simplify permission
      management.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the sidebar. 4. For each user, check the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Verify that no policies are directly attached to the user. 6. Ensure
      all permissions are granted through group memberships or roles.
    Default Value: IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups, or roles
      by default.
    Remediation: 1. Identify users with directly attached policies. 2. Detach the
      policies from these users. 3. Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles.
      4. Attach the policies to these groups or roles. 5. Add users to the groups
      or assign roles as necessary to maintain required access.
