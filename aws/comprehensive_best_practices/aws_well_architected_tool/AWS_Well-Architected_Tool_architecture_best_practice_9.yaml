    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and security
      risks.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access and data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data
      to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL settings for each bucket to ensure no public
      access permissions are granted.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL for each bucket to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket and the account level.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
