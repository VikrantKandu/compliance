  - ID: AWS-001
  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the account. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access sensitive
      resources.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the Security
      Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that all users have MFA
      enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user you want
      to enable MFA for. 5. Choose the Security Credentials tab and click on Manage
      MFA. 6. Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
