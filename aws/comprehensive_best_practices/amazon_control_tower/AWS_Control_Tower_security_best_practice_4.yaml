    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance account security. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access due
      to compromised credentials. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's password
      could gain access to AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches or service
      disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-mfa-devices' to list MFA
      devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security Credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
