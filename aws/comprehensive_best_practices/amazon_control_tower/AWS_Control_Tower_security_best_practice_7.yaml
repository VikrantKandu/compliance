    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and do not allow public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block
      all public access" setting is enabled. 4. Verify that no bucket policies or
      ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all
      public access" settings. 5. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to
      ensure they do not allow public access.
