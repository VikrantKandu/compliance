    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches by exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are not public
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
