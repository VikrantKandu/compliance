    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in data leaks, unauthorized
      access, and exposure of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private
      protects data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket to ensure public access
      is blocked.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket policies for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI to apply the block public access settings: aws s3api put-public-access-block
        --bucket <bucket-name> --public-access-block-configuration BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true.
