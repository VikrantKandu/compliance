    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Launched in a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and enhanced security.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in a VPC provides better control over network
      configurations, allowing for greater security measures such as security groups
      and network ACLs. Without a VPC, instances may be exposed to the public internet,
      increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the sidebar.
    - Check the VPC ID column for each instance to ensure that it is associated with
      a VPC.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and verify
      that each instance has a VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances launched in newer AWS accounts are within
      a VPC.
    Remediation:
    - If an instance is not in a VPC, stop the instance.
    - Create a new VPC and configure subnets, route tables, and security groups as
      needed.
    - Launch a new instance within the VPC using the same configuration as the stopped
      instance.
    - Terminate the old instance that was not in a VPC.
