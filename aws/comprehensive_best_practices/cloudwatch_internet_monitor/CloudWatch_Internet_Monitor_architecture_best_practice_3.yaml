  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Versioning Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps protect against accidental
      or malicious data deletion by keeping multiple versions of an object.
  - Rationale: Versioning provides an additional layer of data protection, allowing
      recovery from unintended overwrites or deletions. Without versioning, data loss
      could occur, leading to potential data breaches or operational issues.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to inspect. 4. Check the bucket properties to verify that
      versioning is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-versioning
      --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically confirm versioning status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have versioning enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs versioning enabled. 4. Go to the bucket properties
      and enable versioning. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-versioning
      --bucket <bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled to enable versioning.
