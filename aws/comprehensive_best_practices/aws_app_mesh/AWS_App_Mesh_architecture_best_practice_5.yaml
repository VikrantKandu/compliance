    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to programmatically verify MFA status
      for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
