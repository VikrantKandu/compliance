    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information, posing security and compliance risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access settings.
