  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure
      and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data theft or loss.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings to ensure that
      they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket policies and ACLs
      for review.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Modify the ACL settings to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings at both the account and bucket level
      to prevent future public access configurations.
