  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access and data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access using the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket's ACL to remove
      public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting in the S3 console for additional security.
