    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible Only When Necessary
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless there is a specific
      requirement. This helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of accidental data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do
      not allow public access unless explicitly required.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible without justification, update
      the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings and
      restrict access to specific IAM users or roles as necessary.
