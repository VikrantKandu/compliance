    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA adds an extra
      layer of protection on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, the
      attacker could gain full access to the account. MFA requires an additional verification
      step, making unauthorized access more difficult.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the list of IAM users and ensure that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      that MFA devices are assigned to all users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
