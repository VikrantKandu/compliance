    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps in maintaining data privacy and
      compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the Permissions tab. 4. Check the 'Block
      public access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked. 5. Verify that
      there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) granting public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Click on the Permissions
      tab and configure 'Block public access' settings to restrict access. 5. Review
      and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
