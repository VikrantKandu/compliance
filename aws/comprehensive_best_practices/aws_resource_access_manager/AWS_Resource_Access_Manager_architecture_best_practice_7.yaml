    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default reduces the risk of data exposure.
      Public access should only be granted when absolutely necessary and with a clear
      understanding of the data being exposed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure buckets and objects do not
      have public access unless explicitly intended.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to detect any unauthorized
      access.
