    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches or unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      protects sensitive data and adheres to security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and ensure that no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket's ACL settings for public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL and bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
