    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in your S3 buckets.
      Public access should only be enabled if absolutely necessary and with proper
      controls.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private by
      default reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check for any public access permissions.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked unless
      explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 3: Click on the "Permissions" tab and edit the "Block public access" settings.
    - Step 4: Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Step 5: Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no
        public permissions are granted.
