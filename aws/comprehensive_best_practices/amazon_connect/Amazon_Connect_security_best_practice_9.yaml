    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a secondary form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect user credentials and reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended to enhance security. Without
      MFA, compromised passwords can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources,
      potentially resulting in data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, click on "Users." 4. Select each user and check the
      "Security credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use
      the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list all users with
      MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, click on "Users." 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Click on the "Security credentials" tab and
      then on "Manage MFA device." 6. Follow the steps to assign a virtual or hardware
      MFA device to the user.
