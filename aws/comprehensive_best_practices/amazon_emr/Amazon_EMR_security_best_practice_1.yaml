    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of authentication before gaining access
      to the account, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because it adds an extra
      layer of security. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the AWS account, and if compromised, it can lead to severe security breaches,
      data loss, and financial impact.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section and check if the root account has MFA enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and verify
      that the AccountMFAEnabled field is set to true.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the "Security status" section, find "Activate MFA on your root account" and
      click on "Manage MFA."
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device,
      hardware MFA device, or other supported options.
