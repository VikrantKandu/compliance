    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches as unauthorized
      users can access sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by
      default minimizes the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the Block all public access setting is enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with Block all public access
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block all public access for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to automate the enforcement of bucket policies that
      restrict public access.
