    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to unauthorized access and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private reduces
      the risk of data breaches and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions and public access settings.
    - Ensure "Block all public access" is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but permissions can be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access," ensure all options are checked to block public
      access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
