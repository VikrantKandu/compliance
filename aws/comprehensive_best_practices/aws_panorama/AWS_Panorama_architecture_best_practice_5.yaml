    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and should be restricted to authorized
      users only.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces
      the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    - Check the S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and ensure compliance with organizational
      policies.
