    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only
      a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e.,
      a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      a second form of authentication. This helps protect the account from unauthorized
      access, especially if the password is compromised. Without MFA, the root account
      is vulnerable to attacks that could lead to data breaches and unauthorized resource
      usage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Check if the root account has
      MFA enabled by looking for the 'MFA' column next to the root account. 5. Verify
      that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console with the root account credentials.
      2. Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. In the 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)' section, click 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the steps to enable MFA using
      a virtual MFA device, U2F security key, or other supported devices. 5. Ensure
      that MFA is activated and tested for successful implementation.
