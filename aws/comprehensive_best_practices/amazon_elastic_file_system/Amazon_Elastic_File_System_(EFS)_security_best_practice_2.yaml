  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. By ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible, organizations can protect their data from unauthorized
      users and potential attacks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions. 4. Check the "Block
      Public Access" settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Verify that
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket in question. 3. Enable "Block Public Access" settings
      for the bucket. 4. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any
      public access permissions. 5. Regularly review bucket access permissions to
      ensure compliance with security policies.
