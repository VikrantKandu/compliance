    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification step
      during login.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has full access to all resources and services
      in the AWS account, and if compromised, it can lead to potential data breaches
      and misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Check the security status section for the MFA on the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account".
    - Follow the steps to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
