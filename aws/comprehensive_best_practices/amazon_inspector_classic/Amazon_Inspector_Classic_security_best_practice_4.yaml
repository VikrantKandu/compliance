    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to sensitive data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This may lead to data breaches,
      loss of sensitive information, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy does not allow
      public access.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket to ensure they are
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
