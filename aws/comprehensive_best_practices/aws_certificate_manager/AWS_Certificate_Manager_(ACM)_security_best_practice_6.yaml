    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Public access can be
      set via bucket policies, ACLs, or other configurations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the public internet. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the "Public access settings" to ensure that public
        access is blocked.
    - Step 4: Verify the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure they do not grant
        public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
        <bucket-name>` to check the public policy status.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>`
        to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Update the "Public access settings" to block all public access.
    - Step 5: Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that grant public
        access.
    - Step 6: Update the ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Step 7: Re-audit the bucket to ensure compliance.
