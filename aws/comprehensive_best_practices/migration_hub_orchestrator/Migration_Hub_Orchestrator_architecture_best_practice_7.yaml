    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. Enabling MFA adds an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, a compromised password could
      lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data
      breaches or other malicious activities.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select a user and choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
