    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting access helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Remove any public access grants from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
