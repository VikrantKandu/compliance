    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by requiring additional
      verification, thereby reducing the likelihood of compromised accounts due to
      stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, there is a higher risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches and other security
      incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA device' is assigned. Alternatively, use the AWS
      CLI command 'aws iam list-mfa-devices' to list MFA devices for users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user to enable MFA for.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam enable-mfa-device' to enable
      MFA for users programmatically.
