    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in an AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to present two or more separate pieces of evidence before gaining
      access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is critical for protecting AWS accounts
      from unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the account. MFA significantly reduces
      this risk by requiring an additional verification step.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA device" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose "Security credentials" and then "Manage MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
