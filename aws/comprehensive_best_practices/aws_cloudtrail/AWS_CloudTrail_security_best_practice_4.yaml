    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires the user to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access to the account, making it harder
      for unauthorized users to access the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      account compromise. Without MFA, if an unauthorized user obtains the root account
      credentials, they can access and potentially compromise all resources within
      the account.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Check the 'Security Credentials'
      tab for the root account. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'My Security Credentials' section under your account name. 3. Select
      'Activate MFA' and follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA using a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device.
