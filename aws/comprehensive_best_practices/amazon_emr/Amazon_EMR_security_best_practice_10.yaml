    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring S3 buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
