  - ID: AWS-S3-01
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data from
      unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. List all S3 buckets and check the permissions for each bucket. 4. Verify
      that no bucket has public access enabled by reviewing the bucket permissions
      and access control lists (ACLs).
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab
      and review the bucket policy and ACLs. 5. Remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACLs. 6. Enable S3 Block Public Access on the bucket
      to prevent future public access settings.
