    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default reduces the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to the public. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the permissions settings for each bucket.
    - Confirm that the bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you wish to modify.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    - Consider enabling the "Block Public Access" setting for additional security.
