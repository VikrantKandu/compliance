    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that multi-factor authentication is enabled for
      all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of verification, in
      addition to their password, when accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's password could
      gain full access to the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring an additional
      verification step.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA' is enabled under the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      MFA devices and verify that each user has an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and navigate to the 'Security Credentials'
      tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign a
      virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled.
