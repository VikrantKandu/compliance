    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised accounts
      due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, a malicious actor who obtains
      a user's password can gain full access to their AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Check each user to ensure MFA is enabled by verifying the "MFA" column displays
      "Yes".
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor Authentication section, choose Manage.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device to the user.
