    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and encrypted. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data,
      and unencrypted data can be vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Encryption protects data at rest from unauthorized
      access and complies with various regulatory requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    - Verify that the bucket properties have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI:
      - Run aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public access.
      - Run aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name> to verify encryption
        settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but encryption is not enabled
      unless specified.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any public buckets, modify the permissions to restrict public access.
    - Enable server-side encryption by navigating to the bucket properties and selecting
      the desired encryption option.
    - Use AWS CLI:
      - Run aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private to set the
        bucket to private.
      - Run aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration
        '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
        to enable encryption.
