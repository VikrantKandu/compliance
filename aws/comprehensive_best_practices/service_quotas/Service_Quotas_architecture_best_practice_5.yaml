    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default
      helps mitigate these risks and protect data integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the permissions by selecting the bucket and clicking
      on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) do not grant public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically check bucket ACLs.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and do not allow
      public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket
      policy to remove any public access permissions. 2. Update the bucket ACL to
      ensure no public read or write permissions are granted. 3. Use the 'Block Public
      Access' settings in the S3 console to prevent future public access configurations.
