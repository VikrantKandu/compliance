    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps secure access
      to AWS resources by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      even if passwords are compromised. This is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each IAM user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list users and
      aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage' under 'Assigned
      MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
