    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the risk
      of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks. Public exposure of sensitive
      data can lead to compliance violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Under the "Permissions" tab, enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
