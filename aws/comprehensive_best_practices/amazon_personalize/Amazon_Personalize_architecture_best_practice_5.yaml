    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Modify the ACL to ensure that "Everyone" does not have access to the bucket
      or objects.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access configurations.
