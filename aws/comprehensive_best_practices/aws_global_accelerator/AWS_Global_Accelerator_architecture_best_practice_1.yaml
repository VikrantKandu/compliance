    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring two forms of verification. Enabling MFA helps
      protect AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access,
      especially if passwords are compromised. MFA significantly reduces the risk
      of account breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click on 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
