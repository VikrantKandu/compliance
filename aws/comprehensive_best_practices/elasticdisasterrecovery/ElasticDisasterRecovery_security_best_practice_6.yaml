    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public read or write
      access, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure or modification.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, where sensitive
      information is exposed or maliciously altered. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
