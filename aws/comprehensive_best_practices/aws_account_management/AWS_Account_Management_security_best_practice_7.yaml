    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial for securing
      data at rest. Without encryption, sensitive data could be exposed to unauthorized
      access or data breaches. Encryption provides an additional layer of security,
      ensuring that even if data is accessed, it remains unreadable without the correct
      decryption keys.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled. 4. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to enable encryption for. 4. Go to the Properties
      tab and enable server-side encryption. 5. Choose the encryption method (e.g.,
      SSE-S3, SSE-KMS) and save changes. 6. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api put-bucket-encryption to apply encryption settings programmatically.
