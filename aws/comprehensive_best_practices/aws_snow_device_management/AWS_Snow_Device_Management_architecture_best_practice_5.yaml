    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to only necessary entities minimizes security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Confirm that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
