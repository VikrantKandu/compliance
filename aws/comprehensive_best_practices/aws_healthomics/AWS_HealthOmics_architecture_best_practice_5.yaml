    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the access permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging for additional security and auditing.
