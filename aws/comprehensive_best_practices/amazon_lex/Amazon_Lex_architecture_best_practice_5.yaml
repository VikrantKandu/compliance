    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that
      no buckets are publicly accessible.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature and ensure the settings are enabled for
      all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review and modify the permissions and ACLs to remove public
      access.
    - Enable the Block Public Access feature for all buckets to prevent future public
      access configurations.
