    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Public access can lead to data exposure, which
      can be exploited by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket ACL (Access Control List) does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Consider enabling bucket-level public access blocking features to prevent future
      changes that could allow public access.
