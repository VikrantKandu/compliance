    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data
      access, which can compromise sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and security incidents. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no public access policies or bucket policies allowing
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow
      public access.
