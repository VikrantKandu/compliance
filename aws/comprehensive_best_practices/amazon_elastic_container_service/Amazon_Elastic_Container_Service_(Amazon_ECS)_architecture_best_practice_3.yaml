    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data
      exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions settings.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs allowing public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, but configurations may change
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions and configurations to maintain compliance.
