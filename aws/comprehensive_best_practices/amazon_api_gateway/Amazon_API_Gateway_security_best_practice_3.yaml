    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring two forms of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised passwords. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users.'
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
