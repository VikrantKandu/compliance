    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Restricting access helps protect data from unauthorized
      users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings and ensure that no public access is
      allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Under the 'Permissions' tab, click on 'Block public access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
