    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen, an attacker could gain unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring a
      second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' in the 'Assigned MFA device'
      section.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
