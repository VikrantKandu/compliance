    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are not using the default
      security group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it allows unrestricted traffic. By ensuring instances use custom security
      groups, you can enforce more granular access controls and reduce the attack
      surface.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      security group(s) associated with it. 5. Verify that none of the instances are
      using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with appropriate rules. 3. Associate the instances with
      the new security group. 4. Remove the instances from the default security group.
