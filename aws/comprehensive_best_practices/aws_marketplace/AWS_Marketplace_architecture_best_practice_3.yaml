    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public read or write access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that ACL settings do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket ACL to remove public read or write access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
