  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
      It is crucial to ensure that only authorized users have access to your S3 buckets.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the Amazon S3 console.
      3. Select a bucket. 4. Under the "Permissions" tab, check the "Block public
      access" settings. 5. Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon
      S3 console. 3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Enable the "Block all public access" option. 6. Save changes to apply
      the new settings.
