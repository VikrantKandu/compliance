    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to be private by default to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be explicitly granted
      only when necessary.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private protects against unintentional data exposure.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data
      manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column to ensure they are
      set to "Private."
    - For each bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab and verify that "Block all public
      access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new buckets are private unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to ensure the bucket is private.
    - Review and remove any unnecessary bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs)
      that grant public access.
