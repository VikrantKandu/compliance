    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are
      private by default reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and check for any buckets with public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      verify bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for bucket policies allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Modify bucket policies to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to disable public access by setting the bucket ACL to private
      and removing public policies.
