    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce
      the risk of unauthorized data access. Public buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors to access, modify, or delete sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that the public access
      settings are disabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket's permissions and remove any public access settings.
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
