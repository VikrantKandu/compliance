    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions,
      which could expose sensitive data to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to the
      bucket.
