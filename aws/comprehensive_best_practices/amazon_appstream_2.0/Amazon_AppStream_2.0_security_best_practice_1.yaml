    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      access and data breaches, potentially resulting in financial loss and damage
      to reputation.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Ensure that no bucket
      has public read or write permissions enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab
      and remove any public access granted under 'Public access settings' or 'Bucket
      policy'. 5. Ensure that any required access is managed through IAM roles and
      policies with the principle of least privilege.
