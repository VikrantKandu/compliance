    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Server-side encryption should be enabled for all S3 buckets to protect
      data at rest. This ensures that any data stored in the bucket is encrypted using
      either AWS-managed keys or customer-provided keys.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data stored
      in S3 from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data is vulnerable to interception and misuse if accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review its properties.
    - Check the 'Default encryption' section to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Default encryption', select 'Enable' and choose the appropriate encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption to the bucket.
