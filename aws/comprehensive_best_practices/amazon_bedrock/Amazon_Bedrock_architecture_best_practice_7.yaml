  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private prevents unauthorized access
      and protects data integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Under the Permissions tab, check the Block
      Public Access settings. 5. Ensure that all public access is blocked. 6. Verify
      that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the non-compliant bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Enable
      Block all public access. 5. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure
      no public access is granted. 6. Save changes and verify that the bucket is no
      longer publicly accessible.
