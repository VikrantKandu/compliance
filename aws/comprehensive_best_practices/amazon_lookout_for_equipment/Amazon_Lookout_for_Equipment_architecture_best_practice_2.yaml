    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      data privacy and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions and ensure that
      'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policy grants
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access settings.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Click on 'Permissions'
      and enable 'Block all public access'. 5. Review and modify any bucket policies
      that allow public access to ensure they restrict access appropriately.
