    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to unauthorized data access and potential data leaks. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure that
      public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify that the bucket does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and permissions to remove any public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
