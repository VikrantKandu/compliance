    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks. Public access to S3 buckets can
      lead to exposure of sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive information to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure that no public access is granted.
    - Enable the block public access settings for the bucket through the AWS Management
      Console or AWS CLI.
