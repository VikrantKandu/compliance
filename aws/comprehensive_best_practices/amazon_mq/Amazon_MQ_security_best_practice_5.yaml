    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to log all account
      activity. CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or
      an AWS service in your account.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail ensures that all activities are logged, which is
      essential for security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.
      Without CloudTrail, unauthorized or unintended actions may go unnoticed, posing
      security risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Step 3: Check if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions.
    - Step 4: Verify that there is at least one trail that applies to all regions.
    Default Value: By default, CloudTrail is not enabled for all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Step 3: Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Step 4: Ensure logging is enabled and the trail is configured to log all management
        events.
