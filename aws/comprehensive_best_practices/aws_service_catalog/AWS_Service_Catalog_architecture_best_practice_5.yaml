    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are attached to groups or roles
      rather than individual users. Attaching policies to groups or roles improves
      manageability and security by allowing you to apply changes consistently across
      multiple users.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to inconsistent permissions
      management and potential security risks. By using groups or roles, you can more
      easily manage permissions and ensure that users have the correct access. This
      practice reduces the complexity of managing permissions and improves security
      posture.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM users and check if any policies are directly attached.
    - Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies directly attached to IAM users.
    - Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles that match the required permissions.
    - Attach the policies to these groups or roles.
    - Add users to the groups or assign them the roles to ensure they receive the
      necessary permissions.
