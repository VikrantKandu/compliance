    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to sensitive data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to inspect.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure that "Block all public access"
      is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" under the "Block public access" settings.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
