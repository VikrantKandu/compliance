    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default.
      This can expose instances to unnecessary risks.
    Rationale: Using default security groups for EC2 instances can lead to exposure
      of services and data, as they allow unrestricted access. This can result in
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Ensure no instance is associated with a security group named 'default'.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your instance's needs.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the instance.
    - Associate the new security group with the instance.
