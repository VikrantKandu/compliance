    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of the username and password by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: The AWS root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the
      AWS environment, making it a high-value target for attackers. Enabling MFA significantly
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring additional verification.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled on the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      if AccountMFAEnabled is set to true.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
