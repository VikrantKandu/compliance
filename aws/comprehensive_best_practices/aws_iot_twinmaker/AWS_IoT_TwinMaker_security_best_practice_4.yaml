    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block public access settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but specific configurations
      can make them public.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best practices.
