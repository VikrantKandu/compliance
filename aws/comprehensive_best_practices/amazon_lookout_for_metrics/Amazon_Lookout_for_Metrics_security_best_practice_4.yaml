    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      breaches if sensitive data is exposed.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring S3 buckets are private
      by default protects against unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the bucket's permissions
      and remove any public access settings.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL
      to restrict access.
    - Enable block public access settings on the bucket to prevent future misconfigurations.
