    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Public Access Blocked
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have public access
      blocked to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Blocking public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access. If public access is not blocked, sensitive data could
      be exposed to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and confirm that public access
      is blocked.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status to
      verify the public access settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and edit the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure that all options to block public access are enabled.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
