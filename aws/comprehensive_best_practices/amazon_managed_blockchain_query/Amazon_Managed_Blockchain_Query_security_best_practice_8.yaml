    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which means that they do not allow public read or write access. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private reduces the
      risk of data exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the Permissions tab.
    - Ensure that there are no public access settings enabled under the Public access
      settings section.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Review and adjust IAM policies to ensure they do not grant public access to
      the bucket.
