    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is critical to protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data leaks
      and potential legal and financial repercussions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature in the S3 console to prevent any public
      access settings.
