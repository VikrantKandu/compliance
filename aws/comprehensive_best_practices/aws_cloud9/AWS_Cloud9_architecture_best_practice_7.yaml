    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide additional verification beyond their
      username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially if passwords are compromised. This is crucial for maintaining the
      security of AWS resources and sensitive data.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS
      CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Click on the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Go to the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Click
      on 'Manage' under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)'. 7. Follow the prompts
      to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
