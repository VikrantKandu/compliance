    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS accounts by requiring users to provide an additional verification
      code along with their password. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect your AWS account from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain full
      access to your AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      an additional verification step.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user to enable MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
