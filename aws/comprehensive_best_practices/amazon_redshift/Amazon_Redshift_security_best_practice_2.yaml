    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps safeguard sensitive
      data and meet compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if the bucket's permissions
      are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties to verify if server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, server-side encryption is not enabled for S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to ensure all new and existing objects in the bucket are encrypted.
