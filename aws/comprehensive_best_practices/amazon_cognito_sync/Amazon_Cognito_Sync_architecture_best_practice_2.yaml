    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed
      by anyone on the internet, which poses a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data being exposed to unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions by selecting a bucket and checking the 'Permissions'
      tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not allow 'Public Access' under 'Block public access
      (bucket settings)'.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
