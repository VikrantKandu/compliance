    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Public' access unless explicitly required.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to programmatically verify
      bucket access policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to prevent future public access settings.
