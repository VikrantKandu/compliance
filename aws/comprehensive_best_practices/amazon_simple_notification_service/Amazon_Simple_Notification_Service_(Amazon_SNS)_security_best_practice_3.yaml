    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data leaks, unauthorized
      data exposure, and potential compliance violations. Restricting public access
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Click on each bucket and select the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block public access settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block all public access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to update bucket settings programmatically if needed.
