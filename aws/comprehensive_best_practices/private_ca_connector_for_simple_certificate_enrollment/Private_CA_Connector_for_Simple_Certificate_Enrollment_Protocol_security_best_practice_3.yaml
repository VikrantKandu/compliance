    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a password, requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code
      from a mobile app).
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access. If the root account's password is compromised, MFA can prevent unauthorized
      users from gaining access to the account. Not enabling MFA increases the risk
      of account compromise, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized
      changes to AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Dashboard". 4. Check the "Security Status"
      section for an indication of whether MFA is enabled for the root account. 5.
      Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the value of the AccountMFAEnabled field.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM service. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Dashboard". 4. In the
      "Security Status" section, choose "Activate MFA on your root account". 5. Follow
      the prompts to configure and enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
