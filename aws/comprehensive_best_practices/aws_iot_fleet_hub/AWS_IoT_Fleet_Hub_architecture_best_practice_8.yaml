    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized data exposure. Restricting access to only authorized users helps
      protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the 'Block all public access' setting to ensure it is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be secured.
    - Click on 'Permissions'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' if it is not already enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
