    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to data
      breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and helps maintain data confidentiality. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data leaks, compliance violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
