    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      which poses a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any statements in the bucket policy that allow public access.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control
      access to the bucket.
