    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to deny
      public access. S3 buckets should be private by default to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data
      to the public internet. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block all public access" setting. 4. Ensure that
      "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is not compliant. 3. Click on "Permissions" tab. 4. Under "Block
      public access," click "Edit." 5. Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
