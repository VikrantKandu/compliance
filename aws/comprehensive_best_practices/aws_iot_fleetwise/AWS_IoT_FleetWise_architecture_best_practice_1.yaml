    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked as 'Public'.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure public access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and review the 'Public access settings'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
