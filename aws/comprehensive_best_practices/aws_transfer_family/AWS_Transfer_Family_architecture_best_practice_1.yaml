    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      typically a temporary code generated by a mobile app, in addition to their password.
      This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access in the event
      of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker can gain full access to the account. MFA provides an additional security
      layer that can prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are exposed.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check if MFA is enabled
      by reviewing the "MFA" column. 5. Ensure that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage." 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual MFA device and complete the setup process.
