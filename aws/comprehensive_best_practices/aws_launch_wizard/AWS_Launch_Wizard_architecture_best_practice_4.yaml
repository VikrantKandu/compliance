    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read or write access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible unless necessary
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions set for the bucket or its
      objects.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the access control list.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM roles or users.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
