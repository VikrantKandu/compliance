    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Server-side encryption protects data stored in S3 by encrypting it
      using AWS-managed keys or customer-provided keys. Without encryption, sensitive
      data may be exposed to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
        is enabled.
    - Step 4: Verify that the encryption is set to either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Step 4: Go to the Properties tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Step 5: Choose either AES-256 or AWS-KMS for the encryption method.
    - Step 6: Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
