    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring a second factor of authentication beyond just
      a password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended to enhance security. Without
      MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access through compromised
      passwords, which can lead to data breaches and misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to see if MFA is enabled by reviewing the "MFA" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
        for each user to check the MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, select "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
