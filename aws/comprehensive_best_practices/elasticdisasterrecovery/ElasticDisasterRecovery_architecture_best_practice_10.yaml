    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access and data leakage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that "Block all public
      access" settings are enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policy grants public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all public access" settings.
      5. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to restrict public access.
