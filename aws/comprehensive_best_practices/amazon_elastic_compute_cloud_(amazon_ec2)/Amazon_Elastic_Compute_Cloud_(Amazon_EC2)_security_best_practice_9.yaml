    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      required. This helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible minimizes this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - If any bucket has public access permissions, it should be reviewed and justified.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
