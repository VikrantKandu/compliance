    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets and
      their objects are private, and only the bucket owner has access to them. Making
      buckets or objects public can lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in data exposure, where
      sensitive information can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead
      to data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and non-compliance with data
      protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket and ensure that public
      access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block Public Access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
