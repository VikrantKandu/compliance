    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket or object is publicly accessible by checking the "Public"
      indicator in the S3 console.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check bucket ACLs for public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not accessible to the public.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public permissions
      from the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
