    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      the AWS environment by requiring additional verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials,
      adding a critical layer of security that helps protect sensitive AWS resources
      from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each IAM user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-mfa-devices for programmatic verification.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the IAM user and choose 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
