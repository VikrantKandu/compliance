    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be a significant security risk,
      as they allow anyone on the internet to view, download, or modify the data stored
      within. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized data
      exposure and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL)
      settings. 4. Verify that the bucket does not allow public access by ensuring
      that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled. 5. Review the bucket
      policy and ensure it does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket permissions
      settings. 4. Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow
      public access. 5. Remove any public access grants from the bucket's ACL.
