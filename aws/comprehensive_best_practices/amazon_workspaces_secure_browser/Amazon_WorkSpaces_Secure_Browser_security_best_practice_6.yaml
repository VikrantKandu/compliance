  - ID: AWS-001
  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps to safeguard
      sensitive resources by requiring additional verification.
  - Rationale: Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's credentials can gain
      full access to the AWS environment. MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring a second form of verification.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "Security
      credentials" tab. 5. Verify that "Assigned MFA device" is set for each user.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select a user and go
      to the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Choose "Manage MFA device". 6. Follow
      the wizard to assign an MFA device to the user.
