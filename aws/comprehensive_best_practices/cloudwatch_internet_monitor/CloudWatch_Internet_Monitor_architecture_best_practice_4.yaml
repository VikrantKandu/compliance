    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to the data stored within. By default,
      S3 buckets should not allow public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protect sensitive data from
      being accessed by unauthorized users. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket settings for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but specific configurations
      can override this.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
