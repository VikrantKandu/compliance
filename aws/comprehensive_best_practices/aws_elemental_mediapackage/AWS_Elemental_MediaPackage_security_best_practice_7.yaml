  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive information
      to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default mitigates these risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions tab. 4. Verify that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Check the bucket's Access Control List
      (ACL) to ensure it is not set to public.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be changed
      to allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the S3 console.
      2. Select the bucket with public access. 3. Update the bucket policy to remove
      any statements allowing public access. 4. Adjust the ACL to ensure no public
      access is granted. 5. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future
      public access configurations.
