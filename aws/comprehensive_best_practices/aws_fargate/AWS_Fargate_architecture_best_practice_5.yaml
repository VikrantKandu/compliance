    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and security. This best practice helps in
      managing and controlling access to instances effectively.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides enhanced security and
      control over the network configuration. It allows for the use of security groups
      and network ACLs to restrict access. Instances not within a VPC may be exposed
      to unnecessary security risks, such as unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Check the list of running instances.
    - Verify that each instance is associated with a VPC by checking the VPC ID column
      for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances should be launched within a VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances not within a VPC.
    - Stop the instance and create an AMI from it.
    - Launch a new instance from the AMI within a VPC.
    - Terminate the original instance not within a VPC.
