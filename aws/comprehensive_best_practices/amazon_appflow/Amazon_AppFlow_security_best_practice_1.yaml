  - Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure, potentially
      resulting in data theft, loss of intellectual property, and compliance violations.
      Restricting public access is a fundamental security measure to protect data.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions and access control
      list (ACL). 5. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 6.
      Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the non-compliant bucket. 4. Enable "Block Public Access" settings
      for the bucket. 5. Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements
      that allow public access. 6. Adjust the bucket's ACL to remove public access
      permissions.
