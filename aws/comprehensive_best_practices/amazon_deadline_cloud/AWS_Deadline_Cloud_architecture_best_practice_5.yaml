    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, posing a security risk.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible protects sensitive
      data and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the block public access settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is checked.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
