    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Securely Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured securely
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. It involves checking for public
      access settings and enforcing encryption.
    Rationale: Unsecured S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access.
      Ensuring proper configuration helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance
      with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Check that server-side encryption is enabled for all buckets.
    - Ensure that bucket versioning is enabled to protect against accidental data
      loss.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access and do not
      have encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Review and modify bucket policies to restrict public access.
    - Enable server-side encryption for all buckets.
    - Enable versioning on S3 buckets to ensure data recovery options.
