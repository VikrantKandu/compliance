  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public access can lead to sensitive data being accessed by unintended
      users, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings for each bucket to ensure public access
      is blocked.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
