    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security to your AWS environment by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication. This check ensures that all
      IAM users have MFA enabled to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, a malicious actor
      with stolen credentials could gain full access to your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user without MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" and follow the instructions to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA.
