    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA requires
      users to provide additional verification factors, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. It helps protect sensitive AWS resources and data by requiring
      users to provide a second factor of authentication, reducing the risk of account
      compromise.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Verify that each user in the list has MFA enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
