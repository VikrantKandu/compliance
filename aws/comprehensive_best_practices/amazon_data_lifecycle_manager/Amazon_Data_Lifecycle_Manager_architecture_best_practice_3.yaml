  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access,
      which can compromise sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are not public helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access policies. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      does not have public access settings enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the bucket's ACL.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab.
      5. Edit the Block Public Access settings and ensure that all public access is
      blocked. 6. Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
