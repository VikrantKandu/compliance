    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group to enforce a least privilege access model. The default security group
      allows inbound traffic from all instances associated with it, which can lead
      to unintended access.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to security vulnerabilities
      as it allows unrestricted inbound access from other instances within the same
      security group. This can increase the attack surface and expose instances to
      potential threats.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - For each instance using the default security group, select the instance and
      click on "Actions".
    - Choose "Networking" and then "Change Security Groups".
    - Select a security group other than the default that follows the principle of
      least privilege.
    - Save the changes.
