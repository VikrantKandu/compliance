    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data theft, compliance violations, and reputational damage. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies.
    - Verify that no bucket has public read or write permissions enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check the bucket's access control list and policy for public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not have public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and permissions to remove public access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
