    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional authentication
      factors. Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials leading to
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, attackers who obtain a user's password can
      gain full access to that user's AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane. 4. Check each user to ensure that
      MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane. 4. Select a user and choose 'Security
      credentials' tab. 5. Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)'
      and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
