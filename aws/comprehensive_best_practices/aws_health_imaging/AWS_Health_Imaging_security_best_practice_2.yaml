    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide additional authentication factors beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. If MFA is not enabled, there is a higher risk of account compromise
      through password theft or brute force attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the Users section.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the Users section.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
