    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide additional verification beyond their username
      and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's
      credentials are compromised, an attacker can easily access and manipulate AWS
      resources.
    Audit:
    - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the "Multi-Factor Authentication"
      column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command "aws iam list-users" and "aws iam list-mfa-devices"
      to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
