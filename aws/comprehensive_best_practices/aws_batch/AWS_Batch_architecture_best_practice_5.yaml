    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an additional
      layer of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms
      of identification when signing in, which helps protect accounts from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of your AWS environment by requiring
      a second form of authentication, which significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or weak credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and other
      security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA enabled' is set to 'Yes'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        verify if MFA is enabled for users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the
      user.
