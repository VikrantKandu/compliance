    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data and maintain compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
