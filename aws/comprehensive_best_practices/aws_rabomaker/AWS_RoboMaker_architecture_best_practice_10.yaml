    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default,
      meaning they do not allow public access. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data access and enhances overall security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket does not
      allow public access.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that grant public read or write
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
