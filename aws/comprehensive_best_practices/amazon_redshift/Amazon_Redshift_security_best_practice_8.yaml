    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose confidential data to the internet, leading to compliance
      violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure
        no public grants are present.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Remove any 'Everyone' or 'Authenticated Users' permissions in the bucket policy
      or ACL.
