    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not configured to allow
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, data leaks, and potential compliance violations. Restricting public access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that no bucket has
      public access enabled. This includes checking bucket policies and access control
      lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Identify any S3 buckets with public access enabled. 2. Update
      the bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions. 3. Use
      the Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to buckets
      and objects.
