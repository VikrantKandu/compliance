    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to unintended exposure
      of sensitive data and resources.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Ensure there are no bucket policies or
      access control lists (ACLs) that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Enable "Block all public access" settings. 6. Review and modify bucket
      policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
