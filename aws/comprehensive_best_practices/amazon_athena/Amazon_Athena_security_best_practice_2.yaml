    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      information from unauthorized exposure. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data
      leaks, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check for the 'Block Public Access' settings and ensure all public access settings
      are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be secured.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block Public Access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is allowed.
