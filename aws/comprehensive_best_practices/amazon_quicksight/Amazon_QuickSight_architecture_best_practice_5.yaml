    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest in S3 is a best practice to enhance data security
      and compliance. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in S3 may be vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, leading to data breaches or compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Verify that the Default Encryption section is enabled and configured with either
      AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable Default Encryption.
    - Choose either AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS)
      for encryption.
