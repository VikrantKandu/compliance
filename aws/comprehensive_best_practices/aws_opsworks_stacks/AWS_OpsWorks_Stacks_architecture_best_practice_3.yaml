    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS accounts. MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring not only
      a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e.,
      a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for AWS accounts significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access,
      data breaches, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and review each user account.
    - Check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, AWS accounts do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and choose the user to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)", click "Manage" and follow the steps
      to enable MFA.
