    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access. Restricting public access
      helps to secure data and comply with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket's Public access settings and confirm that they are set to block
      all public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket's Public access settings to block all public access.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new settings.
