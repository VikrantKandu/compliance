    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong IAM password policy is enabled to
      enforce password complexity and expiration settings, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: A strong password policy helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access by enforcing password complexity, expiration, and reuse conditions. Without
      it, accounts are more susceptible to brute force attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets the organization's requirements
      for complexity, length, and expiration.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account settings'.
    - Enable the password policy.
    - Configure the policy to meet the organization's requirements, including minimum
      password length, requiring at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter,
      one number, and one non-alphanumeric character, and setting a password expiration
      period.
