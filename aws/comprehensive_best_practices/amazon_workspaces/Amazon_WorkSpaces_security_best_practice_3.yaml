    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data
      access, leading to data breaches and potential compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default is a crucial step in securing data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block Public Access' settings
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to grant access only to
      authorized users.
