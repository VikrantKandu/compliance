    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional layer
      of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. It provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to present a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage' under the 'Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA)' section.
    - Follow the steps to assign an MFA device to the user.
