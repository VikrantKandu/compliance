    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password.
      Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps to secure AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks, such as credential
      theft or brute force attacks. Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, click "Manage" and follow
      the steps to enable MFA.
    - Repeat for all IAM users.
