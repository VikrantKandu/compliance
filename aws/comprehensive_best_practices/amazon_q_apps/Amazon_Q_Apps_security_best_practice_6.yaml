    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk of data
      exposure and helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to programmatically
      check bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block Public Access settings.
    - Ensure that all public access is blocked by enabling 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
