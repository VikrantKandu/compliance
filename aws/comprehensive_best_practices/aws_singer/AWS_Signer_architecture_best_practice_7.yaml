    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible minimizes the risk
      of data exposure and unauthorized access, protecting sensitive information from
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Verify that the public access settings are configured to block all public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab.
    - Configure the bucket to block all public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
