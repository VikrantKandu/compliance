    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized public access. By default, S3 buckets should
      not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and
      exposure of confidential information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Disable any public access settings.
    - Remove any public bucket policies.
    - Use AWS CLI to update bucket ACLs and policies to restrict public access.
