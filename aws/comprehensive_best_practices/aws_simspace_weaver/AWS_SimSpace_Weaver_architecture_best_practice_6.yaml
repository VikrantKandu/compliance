    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to AWS accounts. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification, which significantly
      reduces the risk of unauthorized account access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts by requiring an additional form of authentication. This is particularly
      important for accounts with high privileges, as it protects against compromised
      credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA
      devices for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose each user and navigate to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' and follow the steps
      to assign an MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA device is active and required for user sign-in.
