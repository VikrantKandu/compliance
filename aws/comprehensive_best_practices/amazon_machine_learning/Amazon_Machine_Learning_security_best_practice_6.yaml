    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the login process by requiring not only a password but also an additional
      form of verification. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users
      in your AWS account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain access to your AWS environment. MFA helps mitigate this
      risk by requiring a second factor for authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', select 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
