    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the public. Restricting access helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that 'Block
      all public access' is enabled for each bucket. 5. Verify that there are no public
      access policies attached to the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and access the S3 service. 2.
      Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Under the 'Permissions' tab,
      enable 'Block all public access'. 4. Remove any public access policies from
      the bucket policy or access control list (ACL).
