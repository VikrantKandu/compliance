    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect data from unauthorized
      access and is a critical component of data security.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data stored in AWS from unauthorized access and breaches. Without encryption,
      data can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if access controls
      are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if the "Default encryption" option is enabled and a specific encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) is selected.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable "Default encryption."
    - Choose an encryption method, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
