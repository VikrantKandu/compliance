    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification, which significantly reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access, especially in the event that root account credentials are compromised.
      Without MFA, attackers can easily gain full access to all AWS resources, leading
      to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the 'Dashboard' option.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - In the 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the steps to activate a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the activation by entering the authentication codes provided by the
      MFA device.
