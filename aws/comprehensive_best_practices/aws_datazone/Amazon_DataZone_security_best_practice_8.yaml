    Title: Ensure IAM policies are attached only to groups or roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      users, but instead are attached to groups or roles. Attaching policies to groups
      or roles simplifies management and enhances security.
    Rationale: Directly attaching policies to users can lead to complex and difficult-to-manage
      permissions. By using groups or roles, permissions can be managed more efficiently
      and consistently, reducing the risk of granting excessive permissions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Permissions' tab to ensure no policies are directly
      attached.
    - Verify policies are attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies directly attached to users.
    - Create or use existing groups or roles and attach the policies to them.
    - Add users to the appropriate groups or assign the necessary roles.
