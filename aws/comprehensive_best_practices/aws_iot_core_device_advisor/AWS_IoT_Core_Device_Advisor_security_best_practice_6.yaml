    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be easily accessed by anyone on
      the internet, leading to potential data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and comply with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access.'
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
