    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to
      data leakage or unauthorized use of the data stored in them.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Unauthorized users can access,
      modify, or delete the data, leading to data breaches and potential financial
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements allowing public
      access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Re-evaluate the bucket permissions and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
