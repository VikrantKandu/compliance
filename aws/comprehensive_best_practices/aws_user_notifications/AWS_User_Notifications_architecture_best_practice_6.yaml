    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to only authorized users helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block all public access' setting to ensure it is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket through the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
