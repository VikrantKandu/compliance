    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS accounts. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form
      of authentication in addition to a password, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access, especially
      if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to attacks
      such as phishing and brute-force attempts, which can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for AWS accounts.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose a user to enable MFA.
    - Click on 'Security credentials' and select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
