    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for the AWS root
      account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection by requiring
      a second form of authentication beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is crucial because it is the most
      privileged account in AWS. If compromised, it could lead to a complete breach
      of the AWS environment. MFA helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access due
      to compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left pane, select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user associated with the root account.
    - Check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', click 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or
      hardware MFA device.
