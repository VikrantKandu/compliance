    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that no Amazon S3 buckets are publicly accessible unless explicitly
      intended to be public. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data
      stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default reduces this risk.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket has a policy allowing
      public access.
    - Verify that bucket ACLs do not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings for any bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access unless explicitly required.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to all buckets
      in the account.
