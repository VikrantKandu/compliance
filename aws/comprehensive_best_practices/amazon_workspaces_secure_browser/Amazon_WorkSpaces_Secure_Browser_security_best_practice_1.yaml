    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be explicitly granted only when necessary.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default minimizes the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data
      to the internet, leading to potential data loss or compromise.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access
      unless explicitly required.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on "Permissions."
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access, ensuring
      they are restricted to necessary cases only.
