    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker can potentially gain full access to the AWS account, leading to
      data breaches or other malicious activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the MFA column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list all MFA devices in the account and verify their status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the
      user.
