    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of data exposure
      and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check bucket policies and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Action 3: Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Action 4: Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access
        permissions.
