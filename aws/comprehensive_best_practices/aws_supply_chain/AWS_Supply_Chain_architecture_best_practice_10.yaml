    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to keep sensitive
      data private and secure within your AWS environment.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data leakage and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of buckets and check the 'Public Access' column.
    - Step 4: For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the 'Permissions' tab,
        and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: For any bucket allowing public access, go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 2: Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Step 3: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access
        permissions.
    - Step 4: Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to
        control access to the bucket.
