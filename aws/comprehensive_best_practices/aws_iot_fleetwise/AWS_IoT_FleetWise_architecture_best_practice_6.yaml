    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could lead to data exposure. Public access should be restricted unless explicitly
      required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the "Block all public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any permissions that grant
      public access.
    - Implement IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
