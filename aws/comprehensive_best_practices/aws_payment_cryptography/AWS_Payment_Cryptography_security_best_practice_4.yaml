    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and is a critical component of data security in
      the cloud.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in S3 buckets could be exposed
      if access controls are bypassed or misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review its properties.
    - Check the "Default encryption" setting under the "Properties" tab.
    - Ensure that server-side encryption is enabled with either AWS Key Management
      Service (KMS) keys or Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab of the bucket.
    - Enable "Default encryption" and choose the appropriate encryption method (SSE-S3
      or SSE-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to new objects stored in the bucket.
