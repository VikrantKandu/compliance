    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. This check helps prevent data leaks and ensures compliance with data protection
      regulations by restricting bucket access to authorized users only.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure that public access is restricted.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to update.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
