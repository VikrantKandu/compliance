    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs that are approved
      and maintained by the organization to ensure security and compliance.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are secure and compliant
      with organizational policies, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and unauthorized
      configurations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that the AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by the organization.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to list instances and their AMI IDs and cross-reference
      with the approved list.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly or privately available
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan for replacement or re-launch of these instances using an approved AMI.
    - Update organizational policies and automation scripts to enforce the use of
      approved AMIs for future launches.
