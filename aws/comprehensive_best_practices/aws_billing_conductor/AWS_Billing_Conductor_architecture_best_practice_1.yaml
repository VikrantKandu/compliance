    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and helps maintain data privacy and security. Public buckets can
      inadvertently expose sensitive information, leading to compliance violations
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
