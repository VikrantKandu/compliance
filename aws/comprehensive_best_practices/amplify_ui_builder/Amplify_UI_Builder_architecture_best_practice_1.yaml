    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited to download or upload malicious content.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for controlled
      access.
