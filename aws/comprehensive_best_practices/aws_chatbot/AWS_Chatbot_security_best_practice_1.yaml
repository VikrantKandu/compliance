    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data privacy and compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for the account and
      each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket and the AWS account.
