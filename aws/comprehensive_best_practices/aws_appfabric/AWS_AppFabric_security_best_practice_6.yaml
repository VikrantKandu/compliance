    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining
      data confidentiality and integrity. Unrestricted public access can result in
      unauthorized data exposure, leading to potential data leaks and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires remediation.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies or ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
