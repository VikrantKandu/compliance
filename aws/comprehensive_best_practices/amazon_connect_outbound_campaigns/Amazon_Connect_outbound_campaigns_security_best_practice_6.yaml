    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in AWS S3. Public access
      to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and potential data loss.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored within them. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      and data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that public access
      settings are configured to block public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    - Review bucket policies using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
