    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to unauthorized access and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
