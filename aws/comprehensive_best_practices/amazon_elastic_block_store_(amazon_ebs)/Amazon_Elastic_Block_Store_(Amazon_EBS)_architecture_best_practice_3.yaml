    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring that buckets are private helps protect sensitive data and comply
      with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions granted.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
