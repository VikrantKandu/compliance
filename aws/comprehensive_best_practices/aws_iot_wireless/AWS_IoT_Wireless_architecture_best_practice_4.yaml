    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are built from a secure
      and validated source, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and unauthorized
      software. Unapproved AMIs may contain outdated or insecure configurations that
      could expose the environment to security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running instances and their associated AMIs.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by the
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Terminate or replace these instances with ones launched from approved AMIs.
    - Update organizational policies to enforce the use of approved AMIs when launching
      new instances.
