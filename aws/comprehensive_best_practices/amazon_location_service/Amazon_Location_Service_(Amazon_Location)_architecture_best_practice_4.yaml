    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the bucket policy status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can change settings
      to make them public.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Apply changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
