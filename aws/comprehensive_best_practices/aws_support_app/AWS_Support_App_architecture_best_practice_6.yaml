    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket's ACL settings to ensure they do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket's ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
