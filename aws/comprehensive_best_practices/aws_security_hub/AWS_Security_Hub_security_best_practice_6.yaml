    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and increase
      the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is critical to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Misconfigured S3
      buckets have been a common source of data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for public access
      indicators. 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its properties.
      5. Under the 'Permissions' tab, ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket ACL for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable 'Block
      all public access'. 5. Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow
      public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> --acl private to set the ACL to private.
