    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within them. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality
      and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors,
      leading to unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of buckets and identify any with public access settings.
    - Step 4: For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL)
        to ensure that they are not granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: For buckets with public access, modify the bucket policy and ACL to
        remove any public access permissions.
    - Action 2: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
    - Action 3: Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with privacy
        policies.
