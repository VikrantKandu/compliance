    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information
      and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that there are no public access settings enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      check for 'AllUsers' or 'AuthenticatedUsers' in the grants.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
