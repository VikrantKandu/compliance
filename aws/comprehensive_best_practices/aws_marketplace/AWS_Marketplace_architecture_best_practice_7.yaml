    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies and ACLs for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and disable public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Confirm the changes and ensure the bucket is now private.
