    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized public access. S3 buckets should have appropriate permissions
      and policies to restrict access to only trusted users and services.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of exposing data to the public internet.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that "Block all
      public access" settings are enabled. 5. Check the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. If any bucket is found to be public, go to the S3 console. 2.
      Select the bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 3. Enable "Block all public
      access" settings. 4. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any
      public access permissions.
