    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data loss, or data manipulation. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have any public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable any public access settings or remove any public access policies.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
