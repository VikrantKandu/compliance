    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environments by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication
      in addition to their password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      in the event that a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      could lead to unauthorized actions, including data breaches and resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      virtual MFA devices and cross-reference with users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor Authentication section, choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
