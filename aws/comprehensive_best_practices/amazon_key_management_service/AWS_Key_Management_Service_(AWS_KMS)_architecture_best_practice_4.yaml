    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for each bucket to ensure
      that they do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL
      to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
