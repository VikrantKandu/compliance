    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access permissions.
      Publicly accessible buckets can potentially expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data leaks and potential compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible is a fundamental security practice.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, remove the public access from the bucket
      policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy and ACL
      settings to restrict access.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket or at the account level
      to prevent future public access configurations.
