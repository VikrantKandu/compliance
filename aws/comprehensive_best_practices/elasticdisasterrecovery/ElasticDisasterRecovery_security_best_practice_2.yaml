    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      and services, and its compromise could lead to severe security breaches. MFA
      adds an additional layer of security beyond just a password.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the 'IAM' service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Dashboard'. 4. Check the 'Security Status'
      section to see if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'IAM' service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the
      root user and choose 'Security credentials'. 5. Under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)', choose 'Manage MFA'. 6. Follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      root account.
