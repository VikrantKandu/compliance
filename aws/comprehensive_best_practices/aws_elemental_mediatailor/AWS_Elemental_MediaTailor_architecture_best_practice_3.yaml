    Title: Ensure IAM users have MFA enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of the username and password by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      resources in the event that a user's credentials are compromised. Without MFA,
      there is a higher risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security Credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
