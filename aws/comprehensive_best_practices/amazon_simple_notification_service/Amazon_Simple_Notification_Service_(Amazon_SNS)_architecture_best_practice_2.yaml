    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.
      Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to access AWS resources. Without MFA, a compromised password could allow an
      attacker to gain full access to AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users." 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices for each user to programmatically
      check MFA status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users." 4. Click on the specific
      user for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the "Security credentials" tab.
      6. In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click "Manage MFA device."
      7. Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for
      the user.
