    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance
      the security of AWS accounts. MFA adds an additional layer of protection on
      top of a username and password, requiring users to provide a unique authentication
      code from their MFA device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's
      password is compromised, an attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions.
      MFA mitigates this risk by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
        to verify the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Ensure that the user registers and activates the MFA device.
