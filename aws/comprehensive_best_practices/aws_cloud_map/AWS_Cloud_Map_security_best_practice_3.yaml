    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets may be configured to allow public access, which
      poses a significant security risk. Unauthorized users could read, modify, or
      delete data if the bucket is publicly accessible. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically check if any bucket has public access
      by reviewing bucket policies and ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' if it is not already enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to update bucket policies programmatically to block
      public access.
