    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions,
      which could lead to data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      public access unless explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring S3 buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of sensitive data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket's access control list.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket settings to
      block all public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 bucket and enable the 'Block
      all public access' setting.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket
      <bucket-name> --public-access-block-configuration BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true.
