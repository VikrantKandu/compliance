    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for
      all IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional verification step
      during sign-in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access in case of compromised passwords. Without MFA,
      accounts are vulnerable to attacks such as phishing or brute force.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and verify the MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select "Users."
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)," click "Manage" and follow the steps
      to assign an MFA device.
