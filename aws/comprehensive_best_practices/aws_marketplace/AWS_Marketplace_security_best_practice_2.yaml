    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can
      lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be exploited by malicious
      actors to access or manipulate data. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. List all S3 buckets in the account. 4. For each bucket, check the bucket
      permissions to ensure that no public access is allowed. 5. Verify the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm that they do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Review and modify the
      bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable S3
      Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
