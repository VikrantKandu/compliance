  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each S3 bucket, review the bucket policy and permissions.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket does not have a public access policy or ACLs
        allowing public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check for public access settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket with public access.
    - Step 4: Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Step 5: Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Step 6: Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
