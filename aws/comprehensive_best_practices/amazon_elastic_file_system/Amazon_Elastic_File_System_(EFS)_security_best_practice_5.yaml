    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no buckets have public access settings enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
