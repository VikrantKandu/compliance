    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to data stored in the cloud. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to maintaining data confidentiality
      and integrity. Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being
      exposed to the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and check the Access column for public indicators.
      4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its properties. 5. Check
      the "Permissions" tab for bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) that
      allow public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket_name> to programmatically verify the ACLs. 7. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL. 2.
      Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access. 3. Use the S3 Block Public
      Access feature to override any public access settings. 4. Regularly review bucket
      permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
