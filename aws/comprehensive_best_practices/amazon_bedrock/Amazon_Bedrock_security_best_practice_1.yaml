  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to deny public access. This
      ensures that sensitive data is not exposed to the public internet.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and exposure of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket's ACL and ensure no public access permissions are set.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, immediately update the bucket
      settings to block all public access.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
