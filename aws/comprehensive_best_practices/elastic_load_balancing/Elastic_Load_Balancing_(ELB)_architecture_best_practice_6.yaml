    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches
      and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in more recent versions. Ensuring the use of the latest AMI helps
      maintain security and operational efficiency.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select instances and review the AMI ID used for each instance.
    - Step 4: Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI ID in the AWS Marketplace
        or your custom AMIs.
    Default Value: Instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified
      during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances not using the latest AMI.
    - Step 2: Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Step 3: Migrate workloads from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Step 4: Terminate the old instance after ensuring successful migration.
