    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check to ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have "Public access" enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure
      no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Use bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access.
    - Consider enabling Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
