    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets reduces the risk of data
      breaches and unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to exposure if unauthorized access occurs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if the 'Default encryption' is enabled for the bucket.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable 'Default encryption'.
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save changes to apply encryption settings.
