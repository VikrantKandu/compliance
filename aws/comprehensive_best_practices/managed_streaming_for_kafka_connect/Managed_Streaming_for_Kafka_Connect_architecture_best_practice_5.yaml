    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication. This check
      ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances account security
      by requiring additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches
      and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure it is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - Click on a user name, then select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" and follow the instructions to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
