    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group because it allows unrestricted inbound traffic. This can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a significant security risk
      as it permits all inbound traffic by default. This can expose the instance to
      attacks and unauthorized access, leading to data breaches and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review each instance's security group.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances associated with the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that adhere
      to the principle of least privilege.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances previously using the default
      security group.
    - Remove the instances from the default security group to ensure compliance.
