    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write permissions, which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that there are no public access permissions set for any bucket.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to programmatically check the ACLs.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to examine bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Remove any public access permissions from the S3 bucket settings.
    - Action 2: Update the bucket policies to restrict access to specific users or
        roles.
    - Action 3: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual
        buckets.
