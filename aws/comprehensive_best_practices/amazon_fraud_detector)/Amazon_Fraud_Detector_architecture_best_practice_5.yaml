    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account provides an extra layer of protection
      against unauthorized access. If the root account is compromised, it can lead
      to significant security breaches and potential data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account under the 'Security Status' section.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on AWS root accounts.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device, U2F security
      key, or other supported methods.
