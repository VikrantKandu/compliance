    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using IAM Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are associated with IAM roles to control
      access to AWS services and resources. IAM roles provide temporary security credentials
      that applications running on EC2 instances can use.
    Rationale: Associating IAM roles with EC2 instances allows for the secure and
      controlled access to AWS services without embedding long-term credentials in
      the instance. This reduces the risk of credential exposure and enhances security
      by following the principle of least privilege.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the IAM role column to ensure an IAM role is associated.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,IamInstanceProfile]'`
      to list instances and their associated IAM roles.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role associated.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the instance that does not have an IAM role.
    - Choose Actions > Instance Settings > Attach/Replace IAM Role.
    - Select the appropriate IAM role from the dropdown and click Apply.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile
      --instance-id <instance-id> --iam-instance-profile Name=<role-name>` to attach
      an IAM role to the instance.
