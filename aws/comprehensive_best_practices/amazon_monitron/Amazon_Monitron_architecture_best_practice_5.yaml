    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled for enhanced security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      a second form of authentication beyond just a password. This helps protect against
      unauthorized access to AWS resources, even if a user's password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the left pane.
    - Select a user and click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the instructions to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA.
