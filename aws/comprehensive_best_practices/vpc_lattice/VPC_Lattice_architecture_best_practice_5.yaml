    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      resources since it allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Restricting traffic
      to only what is necessary helps minimize the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the "Instances" option from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with the necessary inbound and outbound rules.
    - Assign the new security group to the affected EC2 instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
