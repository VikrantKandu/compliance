    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled and Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      password policy is enabled and properly configured to enforce strong password
      requirements. This includes settings such as minimum password length, requiring
      at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric
      character.
    Rationale: A strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized access to
      AWS accounts by enforcing the use of complex passwords. Without a robust password
      policy, there is an increased risk of account compromise through brute force
      attacks or password guessing.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Account settings.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured with the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Prevent password reuse.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Account settings.
    - Enable and configure the password policy with the recommended settings.
    - Save the changes to enforce the policy.
