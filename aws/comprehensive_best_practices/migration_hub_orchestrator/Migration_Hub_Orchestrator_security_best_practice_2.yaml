    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication factor
      beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of compromised credentials. If MFA is not enabled, unauthorized access
      to AWS resources can occur if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each user to verify MFA
        devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
