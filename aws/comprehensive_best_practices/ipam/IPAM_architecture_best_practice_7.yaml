    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encrypting data at rest reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Encrypting data stored in S3 buckets protects it from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data is vulnerable to
      interception and unauthorized access, especially if other security controls
      are not properly implemented.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties to verify if server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
        <bucket-name> to check for encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the properties tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption method (e.g., AES-256, AWS-KMS).
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket
        <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
        to enable encryption.
