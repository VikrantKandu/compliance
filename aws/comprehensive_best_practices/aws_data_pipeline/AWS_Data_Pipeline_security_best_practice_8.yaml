    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identity, enhancing the security of
      the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access. The root account has full access to all resources in the AWS account,
      and its compromise can lead to severe security breaches. Without MFA, the account
      is more susceptible to password-based attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the AccountMFAEnabled field.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, find the option to enable MFA on the root account.
    - Follow the prompts to select a virtual MFA device and complete the setup process.
