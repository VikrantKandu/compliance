    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic.
      Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary risks.
    Rationale: Associating EC2 instances with the default security group poses a security
      risk as it allows all inbound and outbound traffic. This can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Ensure that no instance is using the 'default' security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group unless
      specified otherwise during instance creation.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with restrictive rules tailored to your application's
      needs.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Ensure the default security group is not used for any new instances.
