  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      on top of the username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect
      your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: MFA provides additional security by requiring users to present two
      or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to resources.
      Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to compromise, potentially leading
      to unauthorized access and data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check if MFA
      is enabled by looking for the "MFA device" column. 5. Ensure that all users
      have an MFA device assigned.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6.
      In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
      7. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
