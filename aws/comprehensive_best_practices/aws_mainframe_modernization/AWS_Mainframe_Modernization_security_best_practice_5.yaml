    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, such as a code from a mobile device, in addition
      to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access, even if the account password is compromised. The root account
      has unrestricted access to all resources, making it a high-value target for
      attackers.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account by selecting 'Security credentials'
      under the root account's dropdown menu.
    - Verify the MFA status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Under 'Security credentials,' select 'Activate MFA on your root account.'
    - Follow the prompts to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the setup by entering the MFA code generated by the device.
