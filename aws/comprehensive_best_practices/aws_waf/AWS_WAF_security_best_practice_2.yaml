    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption can help protect data
      by encrypting it before storing it in S3 and decrypting it when accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to exposure if access controls are misconfigured or if the
      data is accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled and a valid encryption method (e.g.,
      AES-256, AWS-KMS) is selected.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket without encryption, go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Enable "Default encryption" and select an encryption method such as AES-256
      or AWS-KMS.
