    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for AWS
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security. MFA
      adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second
      form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If a user's password is compromised, MFA provides an additional
      barrier that can prevent unauthorized access to the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    - Ensure that the 'MFA' column indicates that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security Credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
