    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors to steal or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to disable public access settings.
    - Implement bucket policies that restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
