    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that all S3 buckets are configured to be private and do not
      allow public access. This ensures that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized
      users and helps maintain data confidentiality.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
