    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
      This ensures that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but settings can be altered
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
