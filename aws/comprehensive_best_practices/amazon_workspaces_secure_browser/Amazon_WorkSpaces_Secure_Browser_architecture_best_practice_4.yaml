    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles Instead of Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles rather than directly
      to individual users. This practice simplifies management and enhances security
      by ensuring consistent policy application across multiple users.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to inconsistent policy
      application and increased administrative overhead. By using groups or roles,
      you ensure that policies are consistently applied and easier to manage. This
      reduces the risk of privilege creep and potential security vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 4: Review each user to ensure no policies are directly attached.
    - Step 5: Check that policies are instead attached to groups or roles that the
        user is a member of.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups,
      or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify any users with policies directly attached.
    - Step 2: Create a group or role with the necessary policies.
    - Step 3: Add the user to the group or assign the role to the user.
    - Step 4: Remove the directly attached policies from the user.
