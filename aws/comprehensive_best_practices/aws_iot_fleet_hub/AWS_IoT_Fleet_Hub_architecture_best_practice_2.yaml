    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring they are private mitigates security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that no policies
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on Permissions and review the Block Public Access settings.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to remove
      any public access permissions.
