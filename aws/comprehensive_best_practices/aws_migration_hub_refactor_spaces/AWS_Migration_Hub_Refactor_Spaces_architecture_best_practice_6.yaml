    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information, resulting in compliance violations and reputational
      damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and block public access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
