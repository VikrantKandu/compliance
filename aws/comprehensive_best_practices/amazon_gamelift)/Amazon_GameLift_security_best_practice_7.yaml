    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps protect the confidentiality
      of data stored in S3 by encrypting it before storing and decrypting it when
      accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if server-side encryption is enabled under the Default Encryption section.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
        <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable server-side encryption under the Default
      Encryption section.
    - Choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) and save changes.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command: aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket
        <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
        to enable encryption.
