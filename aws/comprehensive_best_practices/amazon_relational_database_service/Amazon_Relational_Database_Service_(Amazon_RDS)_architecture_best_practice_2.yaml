    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to their accounts. MFA requires users
      to provide two or more verification factors to gain access, reducing the risk
      of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's credentials
      could access the AWS environment, potentially leading to data breaches or resource
      misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, AWS IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
