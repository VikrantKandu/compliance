    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect
      against unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised accounts since it requires
      an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are
      compromised, an attacker can gain full access to the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, click on the user name.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
