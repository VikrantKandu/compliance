    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional layer
      of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms of identification
      before gaining access to AWS resources, significantly reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds a critical layer of security to AWS
      accounts by requiring not only a password but also a second factor of authentication,
      such as a physical or virtual device. This greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access in the event of compromised credentials, protecting sensitive data and
      resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each IAM user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA devices for each
      IAM user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - For each user, enable an MFA device by following the steps provided in the IAM
      user settings.
    - Consider using a virtual MFA device for ease of use and management.
