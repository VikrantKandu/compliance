    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Check for any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Under the 'Permissions' tab, enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
