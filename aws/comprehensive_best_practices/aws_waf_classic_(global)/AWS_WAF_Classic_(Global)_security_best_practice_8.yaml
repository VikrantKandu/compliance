    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets within the AWS account are
      not publicly accessible. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible pose a significant security
      risk as they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have 'Public Access' settings enabled.
    - Check for any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the bucket's 'Permissions'
      tab.
    - Disable any public access settings.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Implement bucket policies that restrict access to only trusted users or services.
