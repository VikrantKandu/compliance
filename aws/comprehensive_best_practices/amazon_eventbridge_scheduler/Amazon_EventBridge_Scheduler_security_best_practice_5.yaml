    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions by selecting the bucket and reviewing the "Permissions"
      tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and edit the "Block public access" settings.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option and save the changes.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
