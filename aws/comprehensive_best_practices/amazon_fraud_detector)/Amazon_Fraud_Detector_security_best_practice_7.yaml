    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to check bucket policies and ACLs for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not enabled.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and conduct security audits to ensure compliance.
