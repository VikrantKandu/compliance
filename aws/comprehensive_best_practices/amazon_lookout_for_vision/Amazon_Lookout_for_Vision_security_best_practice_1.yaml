    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive
      data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled unless explicitly required.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and only the bucket owner has
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Locate the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Consider using the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
