    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. It is crucial to restrict access to only those who need it to
      maintain data security and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check bucket policies for statements allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console
      under the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Consider using Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to restrict public access
      at the account level.
