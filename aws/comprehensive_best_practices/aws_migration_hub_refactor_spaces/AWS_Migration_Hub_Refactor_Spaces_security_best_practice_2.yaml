    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure sensitive
      data is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private prevents unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control
      access.
