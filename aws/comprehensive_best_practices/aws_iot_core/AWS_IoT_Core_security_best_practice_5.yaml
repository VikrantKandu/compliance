    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      such as a one-time password, in addition to their standard credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially in the event of compromised passwords. Without MFA, accounts are
      more vulnerable to attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled by verifying the presence of an
      MFA device in the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' in the 'Assigned MFA device'
      section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
