    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets in your AWS account are not
      publicly accessible, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the S3 service and select the specific bucket.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or access control lists
      (ACLs).
    - Enable bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
