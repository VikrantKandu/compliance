    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. By ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible, you reduce the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" feature.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
