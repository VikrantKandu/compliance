    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to unauthorized users. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions for public access settings.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
