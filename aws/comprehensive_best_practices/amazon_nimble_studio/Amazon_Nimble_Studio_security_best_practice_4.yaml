    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets could expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure.
      Public buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance violations, and unauthorized
      data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure public access is restricted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access, but existing buckets
      may not.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
