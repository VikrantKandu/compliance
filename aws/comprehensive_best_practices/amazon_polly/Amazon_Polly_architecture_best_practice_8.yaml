    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches
      and updates. Regularly updating AMIs helps maintain a secure environment.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been patched in newer versions. This check reduces the risk of security breaches
      due to known vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID used.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI in the AWS Marketplace or your
      custom AMI repository.
    Default Value: Instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless configured
      to do so.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Plan for an update by creating a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Test the new instance to ensure compatibility with your applications.
    - Migrate workloads to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance once migration is successful.
