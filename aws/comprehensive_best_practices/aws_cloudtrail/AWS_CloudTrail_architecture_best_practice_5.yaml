    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access settings.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
