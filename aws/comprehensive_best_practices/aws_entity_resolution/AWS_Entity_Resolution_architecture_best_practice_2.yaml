    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environments by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication
      in addition to their password. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all
      IAM users, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect against unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to their account. MFA significantly reduces
      this risk by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically verify MFA
      is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. Click on a user for whom MFA
      is not enabled. 5. In the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to
      "Assigned MFA device." 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device
      for the user. 7. Repeat the process for all users without MFA enabled.
