    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Access the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
