    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to
      their password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial because it mitigates the risk
      of compromised credentials. Without MFA, an attacker with stolen credentials
      could gain full access to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches
      or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
