    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account adds an extra level of security by
      requiring a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, select "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
