  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be exploited by malicious
      actors to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring that buckets are private
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Access" section to verify the bucket does not
      have public access enabled. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the
      bucket permissions settings in the AWS Management Console. 2. Remove any public
      access permissions from the bucket policy or ACL. 3. Enable block public access
      settings for the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
