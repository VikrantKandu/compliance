    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code
      from a mobile device, in addition to the password. This helps protect accounts
      from unauthorized access in case of compromised passwords.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker
      can gain full access to the account, potentially leading to data breaches, resource
      misuse, or financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the "Security credentials"
      tab.
    - Ensure that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - For each user without MFA, select the user name.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab and select "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
