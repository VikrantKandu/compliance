    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users adds
      an extra layer of security to your AWS accounts by requiring a second form of
      authentication. This helps protect against unauthorized access in the event
      that a user's credentials are compromised.
    Rationale: MFA provides an additional layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access,
      which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized use of AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section, select Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
