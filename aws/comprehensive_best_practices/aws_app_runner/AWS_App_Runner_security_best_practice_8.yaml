    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      unauthorized public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data
      protection regulations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can potentially expose confidential data to unauthorized users. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data leaks and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access settings enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to check
      the ACL configuration.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      review the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy or ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings feature to restrict public access at
      the account level.
