    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of
      security when accessing AWS resources. By requiring a second form of authentication,
      unauthorized access is significantly reduced.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an
      IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to the
      account.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security Credentials tab, then Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
