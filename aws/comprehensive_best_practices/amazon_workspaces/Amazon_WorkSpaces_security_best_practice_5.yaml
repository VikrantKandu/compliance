    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      By default, S3 buckets are private, and access is restricted to the bucket owner.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: It is recommended to prevent public access to S3 buckets to safeguard
      sensitive data. Public access can lead to data exposure and potential misuse
      by unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are private minimizes the risk
      of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and verify that they do not grant
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public or anonymous access.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
