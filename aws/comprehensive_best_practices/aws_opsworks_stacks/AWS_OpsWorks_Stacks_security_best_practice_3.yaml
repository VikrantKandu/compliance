    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by
      requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select 'Security credentials'.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
    - Ensure all users have MFA enabled by repeating the process for each user.
