    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS
      IAM users. A strong password policy helps protect access to AWS resources by
      enforcing minimum password strength requirements.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without a strong password policy, users may set weak
      passwords, increasing the likelihood of account compromise.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Under "Account settings," check the "Password policy" section.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets organizational standards
      for complexity, length, and expiration.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Under "Account settings," click "Edit" in the "Password policy" section.
    - Configure the password policy to enforce complexity, length, and expiration
      requirements.
    - Save the changes to apply the password policy.
