    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private by default helps mitigate this risk.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not
        allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Action 3: For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove
        public access permissions.
    - Action 4: Enable bucket versioning and logging to track access and changes.
