    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group to ensure a more granular and secure access control. Default security
      groups allow all inbound traffic from instances within the group, which can
      pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risk by allowing unrestricted access. This can lead to potential unauthorized
      access and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with the necessary inbound and outbound rules.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the EC2 instance.
    - Associate the instance with the newly created custom security group.
