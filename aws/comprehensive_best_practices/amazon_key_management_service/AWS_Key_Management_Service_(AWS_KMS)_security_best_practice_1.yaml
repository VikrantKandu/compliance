    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure
      no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to remove any statements allowing public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to update bucket permissions, ensuring no public access
      is granted.
