    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to only
      authorized users reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy or access control list (ACL) grants public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy or ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
