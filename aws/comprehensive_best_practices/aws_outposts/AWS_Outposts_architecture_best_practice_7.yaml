    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data stored
      in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of exposing data to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow
        public access unless necessary.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable "Block Public Access" settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Action 2: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Action 3: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access
        to S3 buckets.
