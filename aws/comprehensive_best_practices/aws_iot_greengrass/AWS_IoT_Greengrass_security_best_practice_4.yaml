    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for
      all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to user accounts
      by requiring a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access in case credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA enabled" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" in the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
