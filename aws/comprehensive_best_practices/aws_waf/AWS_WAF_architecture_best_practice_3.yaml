    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should
      be configured to restrict access to only authorized users and services.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are not public mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the ACL does not grant public-read or public-read-write permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the ACL to ensure that it does not include public-read or public-read-write
      permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to apply these changes.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
