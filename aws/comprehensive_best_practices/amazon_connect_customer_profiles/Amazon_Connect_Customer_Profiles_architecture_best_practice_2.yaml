    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches and non-compliance with
      data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that all options to block public access are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Block Public Access" and enable all options to block public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
