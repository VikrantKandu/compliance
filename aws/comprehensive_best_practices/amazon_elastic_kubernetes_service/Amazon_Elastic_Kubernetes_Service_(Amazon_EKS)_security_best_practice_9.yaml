    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any policies granting public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
