    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leakage
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that no bucket has public
      access enabled unless explicitly required and documented.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the Permissions tab. 5. Modify
      the bucket policy or access control list (ACL) to remove public access. 6. Implement
      bucket policies that restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
