    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has "Public" access or "Everyone" granted in the permissions.
    - Utilize the 'Block Public Access' settings to confirm that public access is
      restricted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify bucket permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' for the bucket.
    - Remove any policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant public access.
