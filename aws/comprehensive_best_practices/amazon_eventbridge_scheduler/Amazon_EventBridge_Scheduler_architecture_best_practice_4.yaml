    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should have their
      access permissions configured to restrict public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data leaks and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the "Access" column for each bucket to ensure it is not set to "Public."
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and ensure "Block public access" settings are enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to apply the block public access settings if necessary.
