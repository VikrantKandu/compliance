    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: AWS CloudTrail should be enabled in all regions to ensure that all
      account activity is logged. CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by
      a user, role, or an AWS service in your account, allowing for operational and
      risk auditing, as well as governance and compliance monitoring.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures comprehensive logging of
      all activities, which is crucial for security audits, detecting unauthorized
      access, and maintaining compliance with industry regulations. Without CloudTrail,
      it is challenging to track changes and access patterns, increasing the risk
      of undetected malicious activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that a trail is created and enabled in all regions.
    - Confirm that the trail is configured to log both management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing one to enable logging in all regions.
    - Ensure that both management and data events are selected for logging.
    - Save the changes to apply the trail settings across all regions.
