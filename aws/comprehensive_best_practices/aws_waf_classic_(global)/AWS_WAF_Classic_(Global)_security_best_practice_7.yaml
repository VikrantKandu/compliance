    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to
      data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to S3 and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
