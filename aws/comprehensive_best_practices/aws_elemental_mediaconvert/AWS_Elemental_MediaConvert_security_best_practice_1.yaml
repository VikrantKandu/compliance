    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Public buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access, modify, or delete data.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify bucket permissions.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Step 5: Update the bucket ACL to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Step 6: Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access
        configurations.
