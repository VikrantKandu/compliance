    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
      It is crucial to restrict access to only those who need it.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and unauthorized data access. By ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible, you minimize the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that the 'Block all
      public access' setting is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
