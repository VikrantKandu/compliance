    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk by
      potentially exposing sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure public
      access is not granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to verify that public access is blocked.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the bucket policy and
      ACL settings.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM roles or users as
      needed.
    - Re-evaluate any business requirements that necessitate public access and apply
      the principle of least privilege.
