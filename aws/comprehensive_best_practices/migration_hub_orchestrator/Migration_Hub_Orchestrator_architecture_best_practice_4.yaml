    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      S3 buckets should be configured to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks and enhances data security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled
      for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the bucket permissions
      in the AWS Management Console.
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      they are restricted to authorized users only.
