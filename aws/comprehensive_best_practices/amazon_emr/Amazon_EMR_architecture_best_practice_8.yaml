    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by
      requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security beyond just
      a username and password. It helps protect against unauthorized access, even
      if credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - Check each user to confirm that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users and choose the specific user.
    - Click on the Security credentials tab.
    - Under the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section, click Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device for the user.
