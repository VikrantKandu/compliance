    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized data
      access.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data and lead to compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket's permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      and bucket levels.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access, but this
      can be changed by users.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to modify the bucket policy
      and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
