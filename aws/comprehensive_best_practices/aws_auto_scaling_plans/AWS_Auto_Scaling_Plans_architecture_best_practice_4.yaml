    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Public buckets can be exploited by attackers to access or modify data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public
      access" is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
