- rule:
  - ID: AWS-CFG-001
  - Title: Ensure AWS Config is enabled in all regions
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: AWS Config should be enabled in all AWS regions to track configuration
      changes and ensure compliance with security policies. AWS Config provides a
      detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in an account, allowing
      for auditing and security analysis.
  - Rationale: Enabling AWS Config in all regions helps in maintaining a comprehensive
      view of resource configuration changes across the entire AWS account. This is
      crucial for detecting unauthorized changes, ensuring compliance with organizational
      policies, and aiding in incident response. Not enabling AWS Config can lead
      to undetected security misconfigurations and non-compliance with regulatory
      standards.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the AWS Config
      service. 3. Verify that AWS Config is enabled in all regions by checking the
      configuration settings. 4. Ensure that all necessary resources are being tracked
      and that appropriate rules are in place.
  - Default Value: AWS Config is not enabled by default in all regions.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console. 2. Select the AWS Config service.
      3. Enable AWS Config in each region where it is not currently enabled. 4. Set
      up configuration recording for all required resources. 5. Implement necessary
      AWS Config rules to monitor compliance with security policies.
