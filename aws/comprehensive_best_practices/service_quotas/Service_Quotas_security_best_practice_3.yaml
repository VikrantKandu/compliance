    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. This involves configuring bucket policies and access control
      lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Restricting public access minimizes these risks and
      ensures data is only accessible by authorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block public access settings and ensure that all options are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDK to run the command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
        <bucket-name> and verify that the grants do not include public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Enable block public access settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with best practices.
