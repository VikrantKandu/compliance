  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard sensitive data and
      meets compliance requirements.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption for S3 buckets protects data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data is vulnerable to
      interception and misuse, which can lead to compliance violations and reputational
      damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the properties to see if 'Default encryption' is enabled.
      4. Verify that the encryption type is either AES-256 or AWS-KMS. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket_name>
      to check the encryption status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is not encrypted. 4. Go to the 'Properties' tab. 5.
      Under 'Default encryption', select 'Enable'. 6. Choose the desired encryption
      method (AES-256 or AWS-KMS). 7. Save the changes.
