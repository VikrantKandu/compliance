    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions set.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove public access.
