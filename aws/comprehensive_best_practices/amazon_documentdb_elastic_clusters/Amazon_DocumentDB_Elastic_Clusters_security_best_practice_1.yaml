    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and data breaches. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
