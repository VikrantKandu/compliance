    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification. This reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access due to compromised passwords.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, the account
      could be accessed by malicious actors, leading to potential data breaches and
      service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically check MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA for the user.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users without MFA enabled.
