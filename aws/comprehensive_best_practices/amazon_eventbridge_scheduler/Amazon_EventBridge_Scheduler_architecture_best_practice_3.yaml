    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches. Unauthorized users can access, modify, or delete
      sensitive data if the bucket is not properly secured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for public access indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its settings.
    - Check the Permissions tab for public access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Consider enabling the S3 Block Public Access feature for additional protection.
