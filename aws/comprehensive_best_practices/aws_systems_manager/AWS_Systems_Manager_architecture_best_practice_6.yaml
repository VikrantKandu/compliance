    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access, which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public
      access" is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to review the ACL settings
      and ensure no public access is granted.
    - Review the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy and confirm no public
      access is allowed.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked unless
      explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update policies and ACLs if necessary.
