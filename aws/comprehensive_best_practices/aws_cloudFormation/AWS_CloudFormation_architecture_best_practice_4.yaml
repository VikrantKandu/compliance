    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACLs for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not accessible to the public.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy or ACLs.
