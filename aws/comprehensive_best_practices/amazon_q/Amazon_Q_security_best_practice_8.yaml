    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound
      access, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it typically allows all inbound traffic. Restricting inbound access
      to only necessary IP addresses and ports reduces the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound rules.
    - Assign the new security group to the EC2 instances.
    - Remove the default security group association from the instances.
