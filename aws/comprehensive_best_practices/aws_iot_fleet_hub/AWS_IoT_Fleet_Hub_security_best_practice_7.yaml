  - Title: Ensure CloudFront Distributions Have Logging Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFront distributions have logging
      enabled to capture access logs for monitoring and auditing purposes. Enabling
      logging allows you to track requests made to your distribution, which is crucial
      for security analysis and performance monitoring.
  - Rationale: Enabling logging on CloudFront distributions helps in identifying potential
      security threats and understanding user behavior. Without logging, it becomes
      difficult to perform forensic investigations and compliance audits. Not having
      access logs can lead to a lack of visibility into distribution usage and potential
      unauthorized access.
  - Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to verify if logging is enabled
      for each CloudFront distribution. In the console, navigate to the CloudFront
      distributions, select a distribution, and check the settings for logging. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws cloudfront get-distribution-config and check the
      Logging configuration.
  - Default Value: By default, AWS CloudFront distributions do not have logging enabled.
  - Remediation: To enable logging, go to the AWS Management Console, select the CloudFront
      distribution, and edit the distribution settings to enable logging. Specify
      an S3 bucket to store the logs and configure permissions accordingly. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI to update the distribution configuration and enable logging.
