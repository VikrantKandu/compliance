    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private minimizes the risk of data breaches by restricting
      access to authorized users only. Public buckets can lead to accidental data
      exposure and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
