    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification. Enabling MFA for
      all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to compromise due to
      weak or stolen passwords. Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the sidebar.
    - Check the "MFA" column for each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the sidebar.
    - Click on each user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" under "Assigned MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
