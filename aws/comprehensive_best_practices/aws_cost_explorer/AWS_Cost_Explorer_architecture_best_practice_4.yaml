    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict access to only trusted
      entities to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure no policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
