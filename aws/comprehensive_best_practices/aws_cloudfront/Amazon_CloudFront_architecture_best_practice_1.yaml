    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS services. It requires users to provide a second form of authentication,
      typically a code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to
      AWS accounts. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to password theft or
      compromise, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that 'MFA enabled' is set to 'Yes'.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and click on the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
