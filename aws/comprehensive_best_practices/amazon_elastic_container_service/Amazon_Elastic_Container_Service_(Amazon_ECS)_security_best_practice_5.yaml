    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not have public read or write permissions.
      Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps prevent unauthorized
      data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, data leaks,
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information. By restricting access, you
      can better protect your data.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the "Block Public
      Access" settings are enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable "Block Public Access" settings for all S3 buckets. 2. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access. 3. Regularly
      audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
