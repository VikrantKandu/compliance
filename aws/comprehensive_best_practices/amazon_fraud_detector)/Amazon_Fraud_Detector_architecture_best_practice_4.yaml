    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets could be accessed by unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the "Default encryption" setting for each bucket.
    - Ensure that server-side encryption is enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Choose "Properties" and then "Default encryption".
    - Enable server-side encryption using either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or
      AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS).
    - Save changes to apply encryption settings.
