    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive information
      and maintain compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the 'Access' column for any bucket marked as
      'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and check the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Under 'Block public access', click 'Edit'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review bucket policies and remove any statements that allow public access.
