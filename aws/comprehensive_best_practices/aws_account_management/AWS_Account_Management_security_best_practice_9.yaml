    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable to being accessed or read by unauthorized
      users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify the encryption status of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, server-side encryption is not enabled on S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
      to enable server-side encryption on the bucket.
