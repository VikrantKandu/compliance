    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Limiting access
      to only necessary parties reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Step 4: Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled, unless there is a
        documented business need for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Step 4: Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Step 5: Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
