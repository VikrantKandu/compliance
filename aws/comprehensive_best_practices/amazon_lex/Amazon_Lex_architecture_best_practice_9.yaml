    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password
      and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece
      of information only they should know or have immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials and sensitive
      information by requiring additional authentication factors. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - For each user, check the "Security Credentials" tab to see if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security Credentials" tab and click on "Manage MFA."
    - Follow the prompts to assign MFA to the user.
