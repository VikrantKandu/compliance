    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase
      the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to unauthorized access
      and data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access permissions.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the
      ACL of each bucket and confirm that no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Choose "Edit" under the "Block public access" settings.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Verify that the bucket's policy and ACL do not allow public access.
