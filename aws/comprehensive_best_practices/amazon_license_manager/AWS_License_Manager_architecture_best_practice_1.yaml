    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of sensitive data
      being exposed to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If public access is detected, modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to adjust bucket permissions or employ AWS CLI
      commands to update policies and ACLs.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
