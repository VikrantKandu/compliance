    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information
      and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has "Public" access enabled under "Block Public Access"
      settings.
    - Verify bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to secure.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
