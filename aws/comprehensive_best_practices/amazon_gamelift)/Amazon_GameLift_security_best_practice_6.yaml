    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to
      present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to
      AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of user accounts by requiring additional
      authentication factors beyond just a password. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
