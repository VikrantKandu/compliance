    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have any public access permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-name
      to check for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and the bucket ACL do not grant public access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
