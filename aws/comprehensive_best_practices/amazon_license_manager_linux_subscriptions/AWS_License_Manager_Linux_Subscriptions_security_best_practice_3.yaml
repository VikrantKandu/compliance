  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates this risk.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and verify that no
      public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the "Block public access" settings and ensure all options are checked to
      block public access.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
