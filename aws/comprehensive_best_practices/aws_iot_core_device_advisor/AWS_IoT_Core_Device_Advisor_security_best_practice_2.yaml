    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized parties. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Step 4: Verify that no bucket policies allow public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public
        access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy.
    - Step 2: Adjust the ACLs to remove public read/write permissions.
    - Step 3: Apply a bucket policy that explicitly denies public access.
    - Step 4: Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
