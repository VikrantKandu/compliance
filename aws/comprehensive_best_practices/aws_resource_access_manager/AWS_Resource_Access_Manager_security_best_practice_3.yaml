    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove the public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only trusted entities.
    - Modify the ACL settings to remove any public grants.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
