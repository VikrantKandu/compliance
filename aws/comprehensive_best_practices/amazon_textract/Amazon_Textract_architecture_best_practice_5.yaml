    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and data
      breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private enhances data security and compliance
      with privacy standards.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. This can lead to data
      breaches, compliance violations, and financial losses. Ensuring S3 buckets are
      private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that there are no public access
      settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings to ensure
      no public access is allowed.
    - Implement bucket policies and IAM policies that restrict access to authorized
      users only.
