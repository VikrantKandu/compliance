    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
      This practice mitigates risks associated with compromised passwords.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security, reducing the risk
      of unauthorized access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to see if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-mfa-devices' to list users
      with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
