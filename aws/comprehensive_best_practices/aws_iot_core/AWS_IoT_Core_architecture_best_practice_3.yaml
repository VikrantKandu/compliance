    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security by requiring additional verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to the AWS root account,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account credentials
      are compromised, it could lead to significant security breaches and potential
      data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section for MFA on the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device, hardware MFA device,
      or other supported methods.
