    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is inadvertently exposed. Restricting access to only trusted entities
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the access control list.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket permissions and block public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to apply a bucket policy that denies public access.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
