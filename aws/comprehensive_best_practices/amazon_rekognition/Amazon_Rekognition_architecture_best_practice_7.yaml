    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default. This could
      expose instances to unnecessary risks.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      EC2 instances to the internet or other parts of the network, increasing the
      risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Security Groups under the Network & Security section.
    - Identify the default security group and note its Group ID.
    - Go to the Instances section and select each instance.
    - Check the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group identified earlier.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the application's needs.
    - Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances currently using the
      default security group.
    - Remove the default security group from these instances to ensure compliance.
