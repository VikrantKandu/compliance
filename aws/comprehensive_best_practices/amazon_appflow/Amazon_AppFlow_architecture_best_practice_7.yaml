    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Account Root User
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS account root user to enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root user adds an additional layer of security
      to your AWS account. Without MFA, if the root user credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full control over your AWS resources, leading to potential
      data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Dashboard'.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root user.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the 'Add MFA' option for the root user.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable and configure MFA using a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device.
