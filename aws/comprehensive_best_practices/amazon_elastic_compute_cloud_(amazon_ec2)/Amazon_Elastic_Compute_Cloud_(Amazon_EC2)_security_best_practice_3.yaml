    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to data stored within them. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data exposure and potential security breaches.
    Rationale: By restricting public access to S3 buckets, you mitigate the risk of
      unauthorized data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the
      internet, which may lead to data leaks or compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
