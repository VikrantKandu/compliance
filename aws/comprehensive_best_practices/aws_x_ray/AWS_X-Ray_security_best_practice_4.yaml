    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. This involves checking bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) to verify no public access settings are enabled.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      they are restricted to authorized users only.
