  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to data breaches or leaks.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not public helps maintain
      data confidentiality and compliance with security standards.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access. 5. Ensure that the bucket does not have public
      access settings enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Navigate to the permissions tab. 4. Remove
      any public access permissions in the bucket policy. 5. Disable any public access
      settings that have been enabled. 6. Save changes to ensure the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
