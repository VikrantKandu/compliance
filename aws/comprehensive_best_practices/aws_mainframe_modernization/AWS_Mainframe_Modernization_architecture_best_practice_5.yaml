    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring additional verification beyond just a username
      and password. Enabling MFA helps protect against unauthorized access to AWS
      resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials by requiring
      a second form of verification. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the AWS account, leading to potential
      data breaches and resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Step 5: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
        to list users with enabled MFA devices.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Step 3: Choose the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Step 4: Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Step 5: In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click on 'Manage'.
    - Step 6: Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the
        user.
