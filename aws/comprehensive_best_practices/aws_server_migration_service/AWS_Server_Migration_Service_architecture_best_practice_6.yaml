    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible unless explicitly required. This is important to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that 'Block all
        public access' is enabled.
    - Step 4: Verify that there are no public access policies attached to the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Action 3: Click on the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Action 4: Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
