    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. By default, S3 buckets should not allow public read or write
      access to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private by default helps mitigate these risks.
    Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets and check
      the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow
      public access. Specifically, verify that the "Block Public Access" settings
      are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked unless
      explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation: If an S3 bucket is found to allow public access, immediately update
      the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict access. Enable the "Block Public Access"
      feature in the S3 console for the affected bucket.
