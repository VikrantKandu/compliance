  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA adds an extra
      layer of protection on top of username and password by requiring a second form
      of authentication, typically a mobile device or hardware token.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. If an IAM user's credentials are compromised, MFA acts as an additional
      barrier, reducing the risk of account hijacking and unauthorized actions.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users.' 4. For each user, ensure that
      MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
      <username>' for each user to verify MFA devices are configured.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users.' 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6.
      Under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA),' choose 'Assign MFA device.' 7. Follow
      the prompts to assign and activate a virtual or hardware MFA device for the
      user.
