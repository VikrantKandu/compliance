  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Regularly update EC2 instances to use the latest Amazon Machine Images
      (AMIs) to take advantage of security patches and improvements.
  - Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to security vulnerabilities
      that have been patched in newer versions. Regular updates ensure instances are
      protected against known threats.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the instance type.
  - Default Value: Instances may use older AMIs if not regularly updated.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Plan and schedule updates to use the latest AMIs.
    - Test the new AMI in a staging environment before applying to production instances.
    - Update the instances with the new AMI, ensuring minimal service disruption.
