    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all AWS IAM users to enhance
      security by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could
      lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select a user and choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage' and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
