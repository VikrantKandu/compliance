    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with default security groups
      as they often allow unrestricted inbound access. Custom security groups should
      be used to enforce specific access controls.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can expose EC2 instances to unauthorized
      access due to overly permissive rules. Custom security groups allow for tailored
      access control, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is linked to a default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group if
      no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using default security groups.
    - Create custom security groups with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate EC2 instances with the newly created custom security groups.
    - Remove unnecessary rules from the default security group or delete it if not
      in use.
