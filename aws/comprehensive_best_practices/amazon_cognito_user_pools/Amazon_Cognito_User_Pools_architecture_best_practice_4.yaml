    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead
      to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of data breaches and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not allow public access by checking the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL).
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy'
      to verify that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket's ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable the 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
