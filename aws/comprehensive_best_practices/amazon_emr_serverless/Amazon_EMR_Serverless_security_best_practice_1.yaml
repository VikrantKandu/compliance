    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Public access
      should be restricted unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access minimizes the risk
      of exposing confidential data to the internet, which can result in financial
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they do
      not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure that no public permissions are granted.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to block all public access at the
      account or bucket level.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
