    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is critical to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers to
      access or manipulate data, leading to data loss or reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are created with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
