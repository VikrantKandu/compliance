  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using approved AMIs helps maintain consistency,
      security, and compliance across your cloud environment.
  - Rationale: Approved AMIs are typically vetted for security vulnerabilities and
      compliance requirements. Using unapproved AMIs can introduce risks such as outdated
      software, unpatched vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID of each instance against a list of approved AMI IDs.
  - Default Value: There is no default enforcement of approved AMIs; instances can
      be launched with any publicly available or custom AMI.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify instances running unapproved AMIs.
    - Develop a plan to migrate these instances to approved AMIs.
    - Update instance launch templates and scripts to use only approved AMIs.
    - Consider implementing AWS Config rules or Service Control Policies to enforce
      the use of approved AMIs.
