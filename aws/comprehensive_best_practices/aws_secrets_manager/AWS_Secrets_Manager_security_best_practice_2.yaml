    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and result in data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and potential data loss. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with security
      standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - For each bucket, select the bucket and navigate to the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      public access.
    - Utilize AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
