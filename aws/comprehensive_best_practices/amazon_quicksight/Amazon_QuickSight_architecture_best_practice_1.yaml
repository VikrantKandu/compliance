    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors to access, modify, or delete data, leading to potential
      data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best practices.
