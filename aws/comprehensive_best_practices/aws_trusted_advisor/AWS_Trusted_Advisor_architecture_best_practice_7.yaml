  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check bucket permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
