  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using IAM Roles
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are assigned an IAM role to manage
      access securely. This helps in avoiding the use of hardcoded credentials within
      the instances.
  - Rationale: Assigning IAM roles to EC2 instances allows for secure and controlled
      access to AWS services. Without IAM roles, applications running on the instances
      might require hardcoded credentials, which pose a security risk if exposed.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, check if an IAM
      role is associated under the "IAM role" column. 5. Verify that each instance
      has an appropriate IAM role attached.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role assigned.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select the instance that requires an IAM role. 4. Choose "Actions", then
      "Security", and select "Modify IAM role". 5. Assign an appropriate IAM role
      that grants necessary permissions. 6. Save the changes to apply the IAM role
      to the instance.
