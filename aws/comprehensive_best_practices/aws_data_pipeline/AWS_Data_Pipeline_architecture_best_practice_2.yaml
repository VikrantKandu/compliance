  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can pose a security risk.
  - Rationale: Associating EC2 instances with the default security group can lead
      to unrestricted access to the instance, increasing the risk of unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Ensure none of the instances are using the default
      security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise during setup.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify all EC2 instances associated with the default security
      group. 2. Create a new security group with the appropriate rules for your application.
      3. Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances. 4. Remove the default
      security group association from the instances.
