    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound
      and outbound traffic, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks by allowing unrestricted traffic. It is recommended to create custom security
      groups with specific rules tailored to the application's needs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that the default security group is not in use.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the EC2 instances.
    - Attach the newly created security group to the instances.
