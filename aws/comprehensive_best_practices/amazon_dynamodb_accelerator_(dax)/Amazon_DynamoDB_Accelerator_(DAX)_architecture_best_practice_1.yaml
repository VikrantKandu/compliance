    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of data leaks and ensuring
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the 'Permissions' tab, and
      verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Edit the 'Block public access' settings and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
