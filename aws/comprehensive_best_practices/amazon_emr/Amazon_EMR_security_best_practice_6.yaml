  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Public access can occur
      through bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow any user on
      the internet to access the bucket's contents.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps to protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy
      and security.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Bucket Policy' and 'Access Control List' for any entries that grant
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy or ACL.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings in the S3 console to prevent future public
      access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
