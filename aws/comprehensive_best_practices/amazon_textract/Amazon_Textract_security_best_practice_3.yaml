    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and click on each bucket.
    - Under the 'Permissions' tab, check the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' option is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but specific settings may vary
      based on user configurations.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Save the changes to update the bucket's access settings.
