  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Public buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance violations, and financial
      losses.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access permissions, either through bucket policies
      or access control lists (ACLs).
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
