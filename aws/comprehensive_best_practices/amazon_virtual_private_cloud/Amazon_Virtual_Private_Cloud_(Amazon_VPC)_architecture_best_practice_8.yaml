    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets should be private to prevent unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to exposure
      of sensitive data, resulting in compliance violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACL does not grant public read/write permissions.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default upon creation.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and adjust the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to remove any public read/write permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
