    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption is a mechanism for automatically
      encrypting data when it is written to an S3 bucket and decrypting it when accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
      Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets could be vulnerable to breaches
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets and their properties. 4. Check if the "Default
      encryption" setting is enabled for each bucket. 5. Verify that the encryption
      type is set to either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled. 4. Go
      to the "Properties" tab. 5. Under "Default encryption," select "Edit." 6. Choose
      the desired encryption type, either AES-256 or AWS-KMS. 7. Save the changes
      to enable server-side encryption for the bucket.
