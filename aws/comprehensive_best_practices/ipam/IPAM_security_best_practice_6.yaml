    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, which
      may lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without this check, sensitive
      information could be exposed to the public, leading to security and compliance
      issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure that
      public access is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies for any public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access (bucket settings)", ensure all options are checked
      to block public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any statements that allow
      public access.
