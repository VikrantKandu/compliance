    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS account by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication
      in addition to the password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised passwords could lead to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <user-name> for each user to verify MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Open the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA
      device.
