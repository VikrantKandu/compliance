    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches if sensitive data is stored without proper access controls.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on Permissions and review the Bucket Policy and Access Control List (ACL).
    - Remove any policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Consider using AWS IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
