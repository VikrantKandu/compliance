    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      access only to specific users or roles within the organization.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Restricting access helps maintain data privacy
      and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for each bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
