    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Regularly update your Amazon EC2 instances to use the latest Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure they include the latest security patches and
      features. This practice helps in maintaining the security and performance of
      your instances.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose your instances to vulnerabilities and
      bugs that have been addressed in newer versions. Ensuring that your instances
      are using the latest AMIs reduces the risk of security breaches and enhances
      the stability of your applications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - Review the AMI ID associated with each instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the instance's operating
      system.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with older AMIs if not regularly updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Plan for scheduled maintenance to update the instances.
    - Create an AMI backup of the current instance.
    - Launch a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Test the new instance to ensure application compatibility.
    - Replace the old instance with the new instance.
