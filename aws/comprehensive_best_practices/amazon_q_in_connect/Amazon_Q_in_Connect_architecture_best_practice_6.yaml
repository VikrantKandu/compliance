    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default. This ensures
      that instances are protected by more restrictive security group rules.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to and from instances, potentially exposing them to unauthorized
      access and attacks. Ensuring instances are associated with custom security groups
      with specific rules helps minimize this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance's needs.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the instance.
    - Associate the instance with the newly created custom security group.
