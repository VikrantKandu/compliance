    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data leakage and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets are
      private protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket's permissions settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements granting public
      access.
