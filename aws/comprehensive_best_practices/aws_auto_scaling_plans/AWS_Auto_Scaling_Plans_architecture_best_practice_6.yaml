  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is essential to protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose confidential information and compromise security.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - Verify that all buckets are marked as 'Private'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but settings can be changed
      post-creation.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
