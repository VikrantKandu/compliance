  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private is crucial
      for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. By restricting public access, organizations can protect
      sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that the 'Block
      all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket. 5. Verify that bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket you want to modify. 3. Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public
      access.' 4. Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes. 5. Review and
      modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
