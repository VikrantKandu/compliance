    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of your AWS account. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to present two or more separate forms of
      identification before gaining access to resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources, as it requires a second factor beyond just a password. This
      is crucial in preventing account compromise, especially if passwords are weak
      or have been exposed.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - Check each user to ensure MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on 'Users' and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click on 'Manage' and follow the instructions to
      assign an MFA device.
    - Ensure all IAM users have MFA devices assigned.
