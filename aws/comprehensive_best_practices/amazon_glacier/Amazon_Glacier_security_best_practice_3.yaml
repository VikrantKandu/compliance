    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured with
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets is essential to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to exposure if accessed
      by unauthorized entities. Encryption ensures that even if data is accessed,
      it remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
        <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption".
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256, AWS-KMS).
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
