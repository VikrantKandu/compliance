    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all regions
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to capture all
      API calls for your account. This is critical for monitoring and auditing purposes.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that you have a comprehensive
      record of all API activity. This is crucial for security analysis, resource
      change tracking, and compliance auditing. Without this, unauthorized or malicious
      activities might go undetected.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      console. 3. Verify that a trail is created and enabled in each region. 4. Ensure
      the trail is configured to log all management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the CloudTrail console in the AWS Management Console. 2.
      Create a new trail or edit an existing trail. 3. Ensure the trail is enabled
      for all regions. 4. Configure the trail to log all management and data events.
      5. Save the changes to apply the configuration.
