    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA adds an extra layer of
      protection on top of a password by requiring a second form of authentication,
      which can help prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to the account. MFA significantly
      reduces this risk by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, verify if MFA is enabled by checking the MFA column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      MFA devices and ensure all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
