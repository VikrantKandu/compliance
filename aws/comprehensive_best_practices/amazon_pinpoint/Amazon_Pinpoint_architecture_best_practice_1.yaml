    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are private by default to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be explicitly
      granted only when necessary.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default reduces the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to the public internet. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the access status for each bucket.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
        bucket ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but this can be changed.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Click on "Permissions" and ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - If necessary, modify bucket policies to restrict access appropriately.
    - Use AWS CLI to apply the following command to block public access: aws s3api
        put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private.
