    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      root account to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring
      not only a password and username but also something that only the user has on
      them.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in an AWS
      account. If compromised, it could lead to significant security breaches. Enabling
      MFA helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA on the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled and configured.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA using a virtual or hardware MFA
      device.
