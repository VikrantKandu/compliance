    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can lead to data loss, financial penalties, and
      damage to the organization's reputation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that all public access settings are enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
