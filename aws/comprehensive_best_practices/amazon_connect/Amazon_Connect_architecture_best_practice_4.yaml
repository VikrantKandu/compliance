    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as sensitive
      information may be exposed to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Check each bucket's permissions to ensure that there are no public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the access control list for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have no public access settings enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access," ensure all options are enabled.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy or ACLs.
