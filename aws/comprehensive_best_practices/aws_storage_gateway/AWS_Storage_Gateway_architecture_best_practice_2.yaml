    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Restricting access to only authorized users mitigates
      this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the ACL to ensure no public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
