    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access, modify, or delete data.
    Rationale: By ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data and lead to compliance violations and reputational
      damage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with a public access indicator.
      4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and navigate to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure that public access
      is blocked. 6. Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. In the S3 console, select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      2. Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Block public access". 3. Enable
      all options to block public access and save changes. 4. Review bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove any statements allowing public access. 5. Re-evaluate the
      necessity of public access and implement least privilege access permissions.
