    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encrypting data at rest helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets protects the data stored
      in the cloud from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption,
      sensitive data could be exposed if accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties section to verify if server-side
      encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - To enable server-side encryption, go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab and enable server-side encryption using AES-256 or
      AWS-KMS.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'.
