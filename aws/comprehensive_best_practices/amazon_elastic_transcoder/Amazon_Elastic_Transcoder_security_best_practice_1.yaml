  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches or compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      data exposure. Public access can lead to unauthorized data access, data leaks,
      and compliance issues with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the access permissions for each bucket under the "Permissions" tab.
      4. Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is
      restricted. 5. Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do
      not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and
      ensure "Block all public access" is enabled. 4. Review and modify bucket policies
      and ACLs to restrict public access. 5. Save the changes to apply the new settings.
