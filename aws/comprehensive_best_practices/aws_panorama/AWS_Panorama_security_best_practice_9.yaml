    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms of identification before
      gaining access to resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts and resources by requiring additional verification beyond just
      a password. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data breaches,
      unauthorized resource usage, and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Step 5: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' to list
        users and 'aws iam list-mfa-devices' to verify MFA devices associated with
        each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Step 5: Under the "Security credentials" tab, select "Manage MFA device."
    - Step 6: Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
