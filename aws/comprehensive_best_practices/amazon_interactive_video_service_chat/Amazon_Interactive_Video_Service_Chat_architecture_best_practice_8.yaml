    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks and
      protects sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - Verify that the Access column indicates "Not public" for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and ensure that no ACL grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may change
      over time.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block public access settings and enable all options to block public
      access.
    - Save changes to make the bucket private.
