    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are private, access is restricted
      to authorized users only, reducing the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public
      permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab and enable Block all public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access configurations.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
