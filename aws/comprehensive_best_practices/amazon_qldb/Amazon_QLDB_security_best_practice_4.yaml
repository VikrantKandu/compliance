    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts by requiring an additional
      layer of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra level of security by requiring users
      to present a second form of identification beyond a password. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to see if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify MFA
      status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to open their details page.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
