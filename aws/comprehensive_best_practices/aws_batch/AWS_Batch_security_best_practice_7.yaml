    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
      Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the bucket policy
      and ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
