    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of sensitive data being
      exposed to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Everyone' or 'Any authenticated AWS user' granted
      to any permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to confirm that public access settings
      are blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy or
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with the best
      practice.
