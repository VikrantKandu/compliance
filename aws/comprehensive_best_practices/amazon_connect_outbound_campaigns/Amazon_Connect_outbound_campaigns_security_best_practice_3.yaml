  - Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to record all AWS
      API calls. This provides a history of AWS API calls for your account, including
      API calls made via the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools,
      and other AWS services.
  - Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions is crucial for security and compliance
      as it allows for the monitoring and recording of account activity across AWS
      infrastructure. This helps in detecting unauthorized access and provides a comprehensive
      audit trail for incident response and compliance purposes.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the CloudTrail console.
      3. Ensure that there is at least one trail configured for all regions. 4. Verify
      that the trail is logging to an S3 bucket and has log file validation enabled.
  - Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the CloudTrail
      console. 3. Choose 'Create trail' or select an existing trail. 4. Ensure that
      the trail is configured to apply to all regions. 5. Enable log file validation
      and specify an S3 bucket to store logs. 6. Save the changes to apply the trail
      configuration to all regions.
