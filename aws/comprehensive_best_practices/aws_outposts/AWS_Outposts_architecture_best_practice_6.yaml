    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      unless explicitly required and reviewed.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      public access helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Public Access settings' and ensure that 'Block all
      public access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL and ensure no public access is granted.
    - Review bucket policies using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements that allow
      public access.
