  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a username and password by requiring a second form of authentication.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts. If a user's credentials are exposed, an attacker would still need
      the second factor to gain access, thus providing an additional layer of security.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select each user to view their Security
      credentials tab. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab and select Manage
      MFA. 6. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable and configure MFA for the
      user.
