    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      AWS accounts against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, attackers who obtain
      a user's password can potentially access sensitive data and services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA device' column to ensure an MFA device is assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
