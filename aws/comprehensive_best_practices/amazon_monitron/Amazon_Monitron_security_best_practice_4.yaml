    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of verification,
      in addition to their password, when accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially in cases where passwords are compromised. Without MFA, there is a
      higher risk of unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources, which could lead
      to data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the list of users and verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to list IAM users and their MFA status with the command: aws
        iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab and follow the instructions to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure that all users have MFA enabled by repeating these steps for each user.
