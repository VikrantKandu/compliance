    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 console in AWS.
    - For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any
      public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket or account to prevent
      public access.
