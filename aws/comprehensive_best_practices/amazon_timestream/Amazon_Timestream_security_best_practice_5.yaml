    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. It is
      crucial to restrict access to only those who need it.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can change this setting.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access.
