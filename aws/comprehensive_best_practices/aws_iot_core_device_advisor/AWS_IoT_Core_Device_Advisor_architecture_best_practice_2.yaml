    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    - Check for any public access settings using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review and update policies to align with the principle of least privilege.
