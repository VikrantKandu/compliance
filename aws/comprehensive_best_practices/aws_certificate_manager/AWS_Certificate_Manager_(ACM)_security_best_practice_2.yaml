    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more authentication
      factors. Ensuring that all IAM users have MFA enabled helps protect against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without
      MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker can easily access
      and manipulate AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Review the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-users` and `aws iam list-mfa-devices`
      to programmatically check the MFA status of each IAM user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws iam enable-mfa-device` to enable
      MFA for a specific IAM user.
