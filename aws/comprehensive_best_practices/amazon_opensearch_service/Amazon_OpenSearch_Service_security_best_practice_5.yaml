  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      unless explicitly required and justified.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      exposure of sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are private by default,
      you reduce the risk of accidental data leaks.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket access is set to private and that public access is blocked.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify the
      ACL settings for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be restricted.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and ensure that all public access is blocked.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Re-evaluate the need for public access and configure it only if absolutely necessary
      with proper justifications.
