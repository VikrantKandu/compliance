    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. AWS S3 buckets should
      be configured to restrict public access unless explicitly required for business
      purposes.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Limiting access to authenticated
      users reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that public access
      is blocked. 4. Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm
      that they do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically verify ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the
      bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab and ensure that 'Block all
      public access' is enabled. 4. Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to
      remove any public access permissions. 5. Re-evaluate the need for any exceptions
      and document the justification for any public access that is required.
