    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Public buckets can be exploited by attackers
      to access, modify, or delete data, leading to data loss and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME to review
      the access control list (ACL) and verify no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
