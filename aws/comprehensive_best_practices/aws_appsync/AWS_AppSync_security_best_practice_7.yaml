    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. If MFA is not enabled, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      actions and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select each user and check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify that MFA
      is assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device.
