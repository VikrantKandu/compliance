    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password.
      It requires users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a temporary
      code from a mobile device, to gain access to AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      in case of compromised credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized changes to
      AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the Users section, select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security Credentials tab, and select Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
