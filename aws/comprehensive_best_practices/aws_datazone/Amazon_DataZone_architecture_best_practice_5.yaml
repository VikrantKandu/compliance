    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to
      be private, ensuring that sensitive data is not publicly accessible. By default,
      S3 buckets are private and access is restricted to the owner. Public access
      should only be granted when necessary and with caution.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private minimizes the risk of exposing
      sensitive information to the public internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
    - Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access
      to the bucket.
