  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Public access can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized data manipulation.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked. 5. Verify that the
      bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL).
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to
      ensure that no public access is granted.
