    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without
      MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, the account could be accessed
      by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
