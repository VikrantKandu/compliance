    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access enabled.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access to sensitive data, protecting the organization from potential
      data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to run the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Edit the bucket policy or ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
