  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public by default
      minimizes the risk of accidental exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Check that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure public access is blocked.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to enforce restrictions.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
