    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, unauthorized users
      can gain access to sensitive data and potentially cause harm to your AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for the 'MFA Device' column.
    - Verify that all users have an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and click on 'Users'.
    - Select the user you want to enable MFA for.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click on 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
