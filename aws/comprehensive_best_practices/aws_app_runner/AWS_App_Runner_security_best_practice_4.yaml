    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of
      data exposure in case of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption, data
      stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to data
      leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the bucket properties and enable default encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C) based on your requirements.
    - Save the changes to enforce encryption for all objects stored in the bucket.
