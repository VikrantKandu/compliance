    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential
      information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors,
      leading to data leaks and potential financial and reputational damage. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are private enhances data security and compliance with regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has "Public Access" enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public
      access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket that is publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and ACL
      to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
