    Title: Ensure Amazon S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent data leaks and
      unauthorized access, protecting sensitive information and ensuring compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL)
      settings.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions, such as "Everyone" or "Any
      authenticated AWS user".
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure public access is blocked at
      the account and bucket levels.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
