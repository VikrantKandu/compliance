    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets are private. Allowing public access can expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users. This check reduces the risk of accidental
      data exposure and ensures compliance with data protection standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
