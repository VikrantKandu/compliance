    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and security breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data access,
      leading to data leaks and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block public access" settings are enabled.
    - Ensure no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each non-compliant bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
