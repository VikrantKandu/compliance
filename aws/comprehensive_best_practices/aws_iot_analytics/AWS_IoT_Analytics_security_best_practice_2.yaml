    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stack is Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks are encrypted to
      protect sensitive data and maintain confidentiality.
    Rationale: Encrypting CloudFormation stacks safeguards sensitive information such
      as passwords, API keys, and other configuration details. Failure to encrypt
      stacks can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select a stack and view its properties.
    - Check if the stack is using server-side encryption by reviewing the encryption
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stacks are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - In the AWS Management Console, go to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select the stack you want to encrypt.
    - Modify the stack settings to enable server-side encryption.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the stack.
