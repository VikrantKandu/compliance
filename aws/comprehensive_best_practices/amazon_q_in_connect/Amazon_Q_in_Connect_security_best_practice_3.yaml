    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs)
      to ensure that they do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to verify that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket permissions and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for the bucket to prevent future configurations
      from allowing public access.
