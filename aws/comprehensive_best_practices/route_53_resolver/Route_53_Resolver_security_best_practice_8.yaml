    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data privacy and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify bucket ACLs do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy or ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl to set the ACL to private.
