    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could expose sensitive data to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
