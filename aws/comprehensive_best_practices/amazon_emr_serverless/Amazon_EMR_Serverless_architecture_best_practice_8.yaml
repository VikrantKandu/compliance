    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not use the default security group as it allows
      unrestricted inbound access. This check ensures that instances are associated
      with custom security groups with specific rules.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk because it typically
      allows all inbound traffic, which can expose the instances to unauthorized access
      and potential attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select 'Instances' and check the 'Security Groups' column for each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are often associated with the default
      security group upon creation unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the instance.
    - Attach the newly created custom security group to the instance.
