    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to benefit from security patches and performance
      improvements. Regularly updating AMIs helps maintain a secure and efficient
      environment.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been patched in newer versions. Ensuring that instances use the latest AMIs
      reduces the risk of security breaches and improves system performance.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      AMI ID and verify it against the latest AMI IDs available in the AWS Marketplace
      or from your custom AMI catalog. 5. Ensure that the AMI ID matches the latest
      version.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with older AMIs if not regularly updated.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances running on outdated AMIs. 2. Create a new instance
      using the latest AMI. 3. Migrate necessary data and configurations from the
      old instance to the new one. 4. Terminate the old instance after verifying the
      new instance is functioning correctly.
