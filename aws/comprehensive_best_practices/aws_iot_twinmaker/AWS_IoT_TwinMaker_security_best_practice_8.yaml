    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to
      provide a second form of verification, which helps protect user accounts from
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can
      gain full access to the account. MFA adds an extra security layer by requiring
      a second form of verification, making unauthorized access more difficult.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security Credentials' tab and click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
