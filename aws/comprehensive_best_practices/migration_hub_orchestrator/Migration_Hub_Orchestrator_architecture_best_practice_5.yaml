    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Securely Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured with proper
      security settings to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. It involves
      verifying bucket policies, access permissions, and encryption settings.
    Rationale: Proper configuration of S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Misconfigured buckets
      can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and ensure it does not grant public
      access unless explicitly required.
    - Check the Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public read/write
      access.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for all buckets to protect data
      at rest.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access and do not
      have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from bucket policies and ACLs unless necessary.
    - Enable server-side encryption for all S3 buckets.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies and permissions to align with security
      best practices.
