    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can lead to data exposure, unauthorized access, and potential
      data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive
      data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access. By restricting public access,
      organizations can safeguard their data and comply with security and privacy
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
