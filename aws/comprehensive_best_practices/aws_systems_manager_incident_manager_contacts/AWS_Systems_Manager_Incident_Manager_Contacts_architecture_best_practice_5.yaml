    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect
      your AWS resources by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication,
      such as a time-based one-time password (TOTP), when accessing the AWS Management
      Console or making programmatic requests.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain full
      access to the AWS account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring an additional
      form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled and verify against all IAM users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab, and then choose Manage for Assigned MFA
      device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device, hardware MFA device, or SMS
      MFA.
