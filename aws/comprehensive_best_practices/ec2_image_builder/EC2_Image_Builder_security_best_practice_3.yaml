    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: All Amazon EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private
      Cloud (VPC) to leverage the security and management benefits of a VPC.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides additional security controls,
      such as security groups and network ACLs, which help in protecting instances
      from unauthorized access. Without a VPC, instances may be exposed to the public
      internet, increasing the risk of compromise.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select the 'Instances' option.
    - Verify that each instance is associated with a VPC by checking the 'VPC ID'
      column.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched within the default VPC if
      no specific VPC is selected.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances not associated with a VPC.
    - Stop the affected instances.
    - Launch new instances within the desired VPC.
    - Migrate data and configurations to the new instances.
    - Terminate the old instances that were not within a VPC.
