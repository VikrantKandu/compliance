    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enforced for
      IAM users to enhance account security. The policy should include requirements
      for minimum password length, complexity, and expiration.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Weak or compromised passwords can lead to security
      breaches and unauthorized activities in your AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account settings' from the left navigation pane.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured with the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and
        one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Password expiration period set to 90 days or less.
      - Prevent password reuse by remembering at least 3 previous passwords.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account settings' from the left navigation pane.
    - Click 'Manage password policy'.
    - Enable the password policy and configure it with the recommended settings.
    - Save the changes to enforce the password policy.
