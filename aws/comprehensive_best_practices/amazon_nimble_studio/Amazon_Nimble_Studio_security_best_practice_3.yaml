    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default and only
      accessible to authorized users mitigates the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have any policies allowing public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for all existing and new buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to the
      buckets.
