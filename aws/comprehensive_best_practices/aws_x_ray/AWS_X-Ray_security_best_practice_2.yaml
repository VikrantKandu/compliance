    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials by requiring
      an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      unauthorized access to AWS resources can occur, leading to potential data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure it shows 'Enabled'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify that
      each user has an MFA device configured.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
