    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of data breaches and maintains data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public access settings" and ensure that "Block all
      public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify that the ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click "Edit" under "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
