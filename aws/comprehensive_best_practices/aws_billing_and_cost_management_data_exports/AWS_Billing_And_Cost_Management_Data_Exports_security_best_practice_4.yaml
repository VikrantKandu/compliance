    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from being accessed by unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket policies and ensure no public access permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and then "Block public access."
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to remove
      any public access permissions.
