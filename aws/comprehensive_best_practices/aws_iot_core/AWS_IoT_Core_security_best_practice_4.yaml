    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors, leading
      to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
