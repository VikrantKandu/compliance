    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security
      to the authentication process by requiring not only a password and username
      but also something that only the user has on them. Enabling MFA for all IAM
      users helps protect the AWS environment from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts by requiring
      a second form of authentication. Without MFA, a compromised password can lead
      to unauthorized access to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data breaches
      or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each IAM user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list all users
      and aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each user to verify
      MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Select "Manage MFA device" and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
    - Ensure that all users have MFA enabled by repeating these steps for each user.
