    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access, thereby protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect sensitive information and comply with data privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
