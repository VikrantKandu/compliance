    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private, preventing
      unauthorized public access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the "Access" column for any buckets
      marked as "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and
      ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
