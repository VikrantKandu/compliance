    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account adds an additional layer of security
      by requiring a second form of authentication. This prevents unauthorized access
      even if the root account password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select the "Users" tab and choose the root account.
    - Step 4: Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select "Activate MFA" and follow the on-screen instructions to enable
        MFA.
    - Step 4: Confirm that MFA is successfully enabled for the root account.
