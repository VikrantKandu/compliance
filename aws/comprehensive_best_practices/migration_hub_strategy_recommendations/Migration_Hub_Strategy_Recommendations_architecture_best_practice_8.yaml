    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled to
      protect data at rest. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets ensures that data is protected from
      unauthorized access and complies with data protection regulations. Without encryption,
      data in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading
      to data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check the Default encryption settings to ensure server-side encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable Default encryption.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption method (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C).
    - Save the changes to ensure that all new objects in the bucket are encrypted.
