    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be launched in the default VPC to ensure
      enhanced security and control over network configurations.
    Rationale: Using the default VPC can lead to potential security risks as it may
      have default settings that are not aligned with best security practices. Custom
      VPCs allow for better management of network configurations, security groups,
      and route tables.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - Check the VPC ID for each instance to ensure it is not the default VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched in the default VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new VPC with appropriate security configurations.
    - Launch EC2 instances within the newly created VPC.
    - Migrate any existing instances from the default VPC to the custom VPC.
