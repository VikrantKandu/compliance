    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain
      compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that public access is not
      granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any
      public access.
    - Enable bucket policies and ACLs that restrict access to known and trusted IAM
      users or roles.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at
      the bucket and account level.
