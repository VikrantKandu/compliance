    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches,
      unauthorized access, and data leaks. Misconfigured buckets can expose sensitive
      information to the internet.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as Public. 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view the permissions.
      5. Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL settings do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 console and select the bucket. 2. Go to the
      Permissions tab. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any
      public access grants. 4. Enable the Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
      5. Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
