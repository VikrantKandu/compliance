    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      granted, which can lead to data exposure. It is crucial to protect sensitive
      data by controlling access to S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
