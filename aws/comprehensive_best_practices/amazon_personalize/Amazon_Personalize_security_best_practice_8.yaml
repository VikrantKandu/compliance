    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, posing
      a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access to only authorized users
      or services minimizes the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or Access
      Control Lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket BUCKET_NAME
      to verify the policy status.
    - Check the bucket's public access settings using the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-public-access-block --bucket BUCKET_NAME.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for each bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
