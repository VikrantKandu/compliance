    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets are
      private, and access must be explicitly granted.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that no public access
      is granted.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings to confirm they
      do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
