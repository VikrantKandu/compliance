    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      a second form of authentication in addition to their password, which helps protect
      against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access, as it requires an additional verification step that is
      not compromised by password theft. Without MFA, the root account is more vulnerable
      to attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources
      and data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to see if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam get-account-summary and review
        the 'AccountMFAEnabled' field.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Verify the MFA setup by logging out and logging back in with the MFA device.
