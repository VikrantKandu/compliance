    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and identify any with public access.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
