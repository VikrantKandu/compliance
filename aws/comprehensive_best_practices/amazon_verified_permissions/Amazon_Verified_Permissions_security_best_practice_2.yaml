    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is essential to maintain
      data privacy and security by restricting public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the
      risk of sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to block all public access if necessary.
    - Save changes and verify the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
