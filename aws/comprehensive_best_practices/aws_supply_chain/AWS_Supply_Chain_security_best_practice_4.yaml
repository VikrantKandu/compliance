    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring a second form of verification, which helps protect the account
      from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure to prevent
      unauthorized access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to credential theft and unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches
      and financial loss.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console. 3. In
      the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Review each user to verify if MFA is enabled
      by checking the "MFA" column. 5. For each user without MFA, determine if they
      require console access and if MFA should be enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user account that requires
      MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. Under Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA), choose Manage. 7. Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
