    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets have default encryption enabled to protect
      data at rest.
    Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets protects sensitive data from unauthorized access
      and potential breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, especially if the bucket policy or access controls are
      misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Properties" tab.
    - Check if "Default encryption" is enabled under the "Default encryption" section.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have default encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires encryption.
    - Click on the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," choose "Enable" and select the desired encryption
      option (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply default encryption to the bucket.
