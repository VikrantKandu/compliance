    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that IAM policies are not directly attached to users but are
      instead attached to groups or roles. This practice helps in managing permissions
      more efficiently and securely.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      management and potential security risks. By attaching policies to groups or
      roles, you can manage permissions centrally and reduce the risk of excessive
      permissions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM policies and identify any policies that are directly
      attached to users.
    - Confirm that policies are attached only to groups or roles.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any IAM policies that are directly attached to users.
    - Reattach these policies to appropriate groups or roles that the users are part
      of.
    - Ensure that users are assigned to the correct groups or roles to inherit the
      necessary permissions.
