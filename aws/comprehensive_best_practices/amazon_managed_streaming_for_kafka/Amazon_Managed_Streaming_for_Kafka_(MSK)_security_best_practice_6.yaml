    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      posing a security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure all options are
        enabled.
    - Step 5: Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they
        do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Enable "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Step 2: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access
        permissions.
    - Step 3: Regularly monitor and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
