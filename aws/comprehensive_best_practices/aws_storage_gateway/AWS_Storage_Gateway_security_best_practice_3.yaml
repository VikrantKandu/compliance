    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to be private and do not
      allow public access. This ensures that sensitive data is not exposed to the
      internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks and protects data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Confirm there are no public access policies attached to the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access".
    - Remove any policies that grant public access.
