  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are launched with IAM roles
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should be launched with IAM roles to manage access
      to AWS resources securely. This minimizes the need to store AWS credentials
      on the instance and allows for fine-grained access control.
  - Rationale: Using IAM roles for EC2 instances enhances security by eliminating
      the need to distribute AWS credentials to the instances. This reduces the risk
      of credential exposure and misuse. IAM roles provide temporary security credentials
      that are automatically rotated, ensuring that instances always have the necessary
      permissions without manual intervention.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. Check the IAM role column for
      each running instance. 5. Verify that each instance has an associated IAM role.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role assigned.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances without an IAM role. 2. Create a new IAM
      role with the necessary permissions. 3. Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instances.
      4. Ensure applications running on the instances use the IAM role for AWS service
      access.
