    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password but also a second form
      of authentication. This ensures that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized
      access is still prevented.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your AWS account,
      which can lead to data breaches, resource misuse, and financial loss. It is
      a critical security measure to protect sensitive information and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
        <username> to verify MFA devices are configured.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA for the user.
