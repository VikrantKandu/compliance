    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access" setting
      is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they
      do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not permit public
      access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to control access to the bucket, granting permissions only
      to specific users or roles.
