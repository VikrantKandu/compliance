    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches and unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the Permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically check
      for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to adjust permissions, or use the AWS CLI to
      modify policies and ACLs.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
