    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict access only to authorized users or services.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to restrict access to authorized users only.
