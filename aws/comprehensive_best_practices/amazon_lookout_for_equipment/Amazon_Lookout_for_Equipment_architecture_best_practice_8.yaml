    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: By ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Public buckets can be exploited by attackers to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature in the S3 console to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
