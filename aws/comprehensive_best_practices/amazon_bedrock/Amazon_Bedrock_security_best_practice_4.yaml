    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users with
      console access
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users with console access have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to the user's login
      process, making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access AWS
      accounts, even if they have obtained the password. Without MFA, accounts are
      more vulnerable to password-based attacks.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the Security
      credentials tab for the status of MFA. 5. Ensure that all users with console
      access have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Go to the Security credentials tab and click on Manage
      MFA. 6. Follow the steps to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
