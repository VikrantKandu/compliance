    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS resources. It requires users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access, enhancing the security of the AWS environment.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access.
      If an IAM user's credentials are compromised, MFA provides an additional barrier,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is listed as 'Assigned' under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
        <username> to verify if MFA devices are configured for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Click on the username for which you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
