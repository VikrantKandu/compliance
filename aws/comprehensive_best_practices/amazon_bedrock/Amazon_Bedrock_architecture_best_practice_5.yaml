  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check verifies that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance
      account security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username
      and password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker with stolen credentials
      could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and services.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'Security Credentials' tab to confirm that MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Click on 'Users' and select the user to enable MFA. 4. Go to the
      'Security Credentials' tab and click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
      5. Follow the steps to assign an MFA device to the user.
