    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      access, and potential exploitation by malicious actors. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private protects sensitive data and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block public access" settings.
    - Ensure that all public access is blocked by verifying that the "Block all public
      access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Click on "Edit" under "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
