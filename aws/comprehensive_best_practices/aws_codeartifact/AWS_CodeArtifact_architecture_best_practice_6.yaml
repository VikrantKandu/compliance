    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public buckets can expose data to the internet, leading
      to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure there are no public access settings enabled under 'Block Public Access'.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings to prevent future public access configurations.
