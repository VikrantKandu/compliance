  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets mitigates the risk of data exposure
      by ensuring that data is stored in an encrypted format. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if access
      controls are misconfigured.
  - Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to check if server-side encryption
      is enabled for each S3 bucket. In the console, navigate to the S3 service, select
      a bucket, and check the "Properties" tab for encryption settings. Using the
      AWS CLI, run the command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify that the output includes an encryption configuration.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: To enable server-side encryption, navigate to the S3 bucket in the
      AWS Management Console, go to the "Properties" tab, and select "Default encryption".
      Choose an encryption option such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS. Alternatively, use the
      AWS CLI with the command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
      --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'.
