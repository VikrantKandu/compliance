    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to maintaining data
      privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors to access or manipulate sensitive data, potentially resulting in data
      leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure that all options are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
