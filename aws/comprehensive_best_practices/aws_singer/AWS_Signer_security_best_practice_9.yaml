    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that are approved and regularly updated to include the latest security patches
      and configurations.
    Rationale: Using unapproved or outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities
      and security risks. Approved AMIs are vetted for security and compliance, ensuring
      a secure baseline configuration.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID of each instance against the list of approved AMIs.
    - Confirm that all instances are using approved AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any publicly available
      or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data from the non-compliant instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance.
