    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access to ensure
      data privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this
      risk and protects data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions'.
    - Under 'Block Public Access', click 'Edit'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
