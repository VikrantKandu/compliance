    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to only
      authorized users reduces the risk of data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
