    Title: Ensure CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFormation stacks have their
      resources encrypted. Encryption helps protect sensitive data within the resources
      created by CloudFormation templates.
    Rationale: Encrypting CloudFormation stack resources helps safeguard sensitive
      information from unauthorized access. Failure to encrypt data can lead to data
      breaches and compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select a stack and review the resources section.
    - Verify that encryption is enabled for all applicable resources, such as S3 buckets,
      RDS instances, and EBS volumes.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to describe stack resources and check for
      encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, resources created by CloudFormation may not have encryption
      enabled unless specified in the template.
    Remediation:
    - Review and update CloudFormation templates to include encryption settings for
      all applicable resources.
    - For existing stacks, modify resources to enable encryption where possible.
    - Consider using AWS KMS for managing encryption keys and policies.
