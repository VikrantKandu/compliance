    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data leaks and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the
      information stored.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that there are no public
      access permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
    - Enable logging and monitoring to detect any changes to bucket permissions.
