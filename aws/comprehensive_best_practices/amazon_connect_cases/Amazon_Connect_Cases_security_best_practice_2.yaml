    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List"
        to ensure that they do not allow public access.
    - Step 4: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>'
        to programmatically check for public access permissions.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
        to review bucket policies for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: For any bucket that is publicly accessible, modify the "Bucket Policy"
        and "Access Control List" to remove public access permissions.
    - Step 3: Use the AWS CLI to remove any public access permissions with the command
        'aws s3api delete-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'.
    - Step 4: Enable bucket settings that block all public access.
