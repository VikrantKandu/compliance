    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can
      expose data to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose significant security risks, including
      data leaks and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' options.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
