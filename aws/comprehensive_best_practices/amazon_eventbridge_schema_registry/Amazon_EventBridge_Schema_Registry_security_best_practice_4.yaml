    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Ensure no bucket policy grants public access by reviewing the bucket policy
      in the permissions tab.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket ACL to remove
      public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting in the S3 console for the bucket.
