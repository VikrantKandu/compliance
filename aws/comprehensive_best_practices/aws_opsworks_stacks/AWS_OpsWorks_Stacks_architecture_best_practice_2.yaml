    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to these
      buckets is crucial for maintaining data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket access is restricted to specific IAM users, roles, or
      AWS services.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users,
      roles, or AWS services.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
