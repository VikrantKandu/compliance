  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets protects data from being accessed
      by unauthorized users. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to
      data breaches and unauthorized access, potentially leading to data leaks and
      compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the properties to see if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the encryption status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption using AES-256
      or AWS-KMS.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption
      --bucket <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
      to enable encryption.
