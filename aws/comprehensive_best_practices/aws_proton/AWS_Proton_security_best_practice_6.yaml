    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private. By default, S3 buckets and objects are private, and only the bucket
      owner has access to them. It is important to maintain this configuration to
      protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized users from accessing
      sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of confidential information, which can have severe legal and financial implications.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions to ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to programmatically check the bucket ACLs and bucket
      policies for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and only the owner has access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access granted via bucket policies
      or ACLs.
    - Consider enabling bucket versioning and logging for additional security measures.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to explicitly define who can access the bucket and under
      what conditions.
