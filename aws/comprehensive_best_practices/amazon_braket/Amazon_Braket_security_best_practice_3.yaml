    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption. This is important to protect data at rest by encrypting
      it using AWS-managed keys or customer-provided keys.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
      access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets could be compromised if
      accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab and review the "Default Encryption"
      settings.
    - Ensure that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default Encryption," choose "Enable" and select the desired encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption to the bucket.
