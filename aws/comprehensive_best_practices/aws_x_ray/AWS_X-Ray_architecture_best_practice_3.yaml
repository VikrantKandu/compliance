    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound traffic. Using the
      default security group can lead to potential security risks as it may expose
      instances to unwanted access.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound traffic, which can expose
      instances to unauthorized access and potential attacks. Ensuring that instances
      are not using the default security group helps in implementing a more secure
      and controlled access policy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are assigned to the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per
      the security requirements.
    - Detach the default security group from the instance and attach the newly created
      security group.
