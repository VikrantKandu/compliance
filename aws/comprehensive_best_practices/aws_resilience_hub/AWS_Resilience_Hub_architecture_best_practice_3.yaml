    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored within. This can
      lead to unauthorized data access, data leaks, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and access control list (ACL).
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
