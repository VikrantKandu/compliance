    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each S3 bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to confirm that public access is blocked
      at the account and bucket level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for the account and individual buckets
      to prevent public access.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
