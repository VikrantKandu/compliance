    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential unauthorized data access or data leaks. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps protect sensitive information and maintain data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have "Everyone" or "Any authenticated AWS user"
      granted any permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and ensure
        that the grants do not include public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions under "Block public access" settings.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private
        to ensure the bucket is private.
