    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By restricting public access, you reduce the
      risk of exposing confidential data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and check its permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to restrict public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
