    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance account security. MFA requires users to provide two or
      more verification factors to gain access, adding an extra layer of protection.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring an additional verification step beyond just a password,
      which can be compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks
      such as phishing or credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
        to verify MFA status programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
    - Repeat the process for all users who do not have MFA enabled.
