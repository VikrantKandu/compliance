    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA requires two forms of authentication,
      which provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the AWS root account significantly reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access by requiring a second form of verification. Without MFA,
      if an attacker gains access to the root account credentials, they can potentially
      compromise the entire AWS infrastructure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA under the Security Status section.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Under the Security Status section, select "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA
      device.
