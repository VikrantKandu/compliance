    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail should be enabled in all AWS regions to ensure that all
      account activity is logged. This helps in monitoring and auditing account actions
      across the AWS infrastructure.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that no activity goes unlogged,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized actions going undetected. Without it, critical
      security incidents might not be identified in a timely manner.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that there is at least one trail configured to log events in all regions.
    - Check that the trail is logging both management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or edit an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Ensure that logging is enabled for both management and data events.
    - Save the changes to apply the configuration.
