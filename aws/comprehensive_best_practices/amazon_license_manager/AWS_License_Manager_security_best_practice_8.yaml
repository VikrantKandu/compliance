    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
      Restricting access helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Access' column for each bucket to ensure it is not publicly accessible.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the 'Permissions' tab, and
      verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-name
        to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket, go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent public access.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
