    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure it is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to restrict public access.
