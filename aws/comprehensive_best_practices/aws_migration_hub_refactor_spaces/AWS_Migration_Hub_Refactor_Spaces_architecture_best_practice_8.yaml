    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the 'Permissions' tab.
      4. Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Ensure there are no
      bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Click on the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket. 6. Review and modify
      any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
