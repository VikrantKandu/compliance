    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential misuse.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Verify that the bucket
      policy and ACL do not allow public access. 5. Use AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check ACL settings. 6. Use AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check the bucket
      policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and
      ACL. 2. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket. 3. Regularly
      review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
