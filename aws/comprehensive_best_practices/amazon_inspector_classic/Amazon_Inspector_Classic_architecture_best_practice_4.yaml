    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted at Rest
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to encrypt
      data at rest. Encrypting data at rest protects it from unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest is a critical security measure that helps prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 buckets can be exposed if access controls are bypassed or misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Default encryption" settings to ensure that server-side
      encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify that encryption is configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to configure.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and find the "Default encryption" section.
    - Enable server-side encryption and choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-256
      or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
