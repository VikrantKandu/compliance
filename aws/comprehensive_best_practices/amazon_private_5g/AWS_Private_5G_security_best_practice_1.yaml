    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Restricting public access ensures data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as Public.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block public access settings and ensure they are configured to block
      all public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Under Block public access, click Edit.
    - Ensure all options are checked to block public access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
