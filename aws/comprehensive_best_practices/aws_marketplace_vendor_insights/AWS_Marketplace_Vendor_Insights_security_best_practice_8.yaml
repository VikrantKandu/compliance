    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      and data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access sensitive data, leading to security incidents and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new settings.
