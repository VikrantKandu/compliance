    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to the authentication process. MFA
      requires users to present two or more separate forms of verification, enhancing
      the security of user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing
      attacks and unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and other
      security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Verify each user to ensure that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA Device'
      column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for AWS IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
