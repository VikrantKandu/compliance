    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent any public access configurations.
