    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive
      data and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible protects sensitive information and meets compliance requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the bucket's permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI to update bucket ACLs and policies to restrict public access.
