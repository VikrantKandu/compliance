    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible,
      organizations can mitigate the risk of data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and click on each bucket. 4. Check the "Permissions"
      tab for each bucket. 5. Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket you want to modify. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable
      "Block all public access". 5. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
