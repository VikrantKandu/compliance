    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to ensure data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Public access can lead
      to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public access
      permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
