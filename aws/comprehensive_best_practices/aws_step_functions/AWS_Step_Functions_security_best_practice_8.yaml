    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled and logging
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail should be enabled for all regions to ensure that all API
      activity is being logged. This is critical for security auditing and compliance
      purposes.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail allows tracking of changes to AWS resources, which
      is crucial for detecting unauthorized activity, troubleshooting issues, and
      ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Without it, you may miss critical
      security events.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that at least one trail is created and logging is enabled.
    - Ensure the trail is configured to log all regions.
    Default Value: By default, CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail.
    - Ensure logging is enabled for all regions.
    - Save the changes to ensure all API activity is logged.
