    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring not only a password but also a second form
      of verification to access AWS resources. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps
      protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains
      a user's password could gain full access to the account, potentially leading
      to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify that MFA is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
      to programmatically list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In
      the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts to
      assign a virtual or hardware MFA device. 8. Repeat the process for all IAM users
      without MFA.
