    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all
      IAM users.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      as it requires a second form of verification. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data
      breaches or unauthorized changes.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Click on Users in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to verify if an MFA device is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        --user-name <user_name> to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Click on Users in the navigation pane.
    - Select a user and click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign a
      virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam enable-mfa-device to enable
        MFA for users programmatically.
