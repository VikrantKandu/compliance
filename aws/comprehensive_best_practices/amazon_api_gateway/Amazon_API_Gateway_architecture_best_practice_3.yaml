    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Approved AMIs are those that have been vetted
      for security and compliance purposes.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities and compliance
      risks, as they may not be configured according to organizational security policies.
      Approved AMIs ensure consistency, security, and compliance across all instances.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify if the AMI IDs match the list of approved AMIs maintained by your organization.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs used for launching
      EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan to replace or update these instances with those launched from approved
      AMIs.
    - Update organizational policies to enforce the use of approved AMIs for all new
      EC2 instances.
