  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual
      Private Cloud (VPC). Launching instances within a VPC provides enhanced security
      and control over network configurations.
  - Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC allows for better network isolation
      and control, reduces the risk of unauthorized access, and enables the use of
      security features such as security groups and network ACLs. Instances not within
      a VPC may be exposed to the public internet, increasing the risk of attacks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu. 4. Check the "VPC ID" column
      for each instance to ensure it is associated with a VPC. 5. Alternatively, use
      the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and verify that each instance
      has a VPC ID associated.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances launched in newer AWS accounts are within
      a VPC.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances not within a VPC. 2. Plan for the migration
      of these instances to a VPC. 3. Launch new instances within a VPC and migrate
      applications and data. 4. Terminate the old instances not within a VPC once
      migration is complete.
