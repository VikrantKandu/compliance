    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. Default security groups allow all inbound traffic from other instances
      in the same group, which can lead to unintended access.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can expose instances to unnecessary risks
      by allowing unrestricted inbound traffic. This can lead to potential security
      breaches if one of the instances is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the instance.
    - Associate the new security group with the instance.
