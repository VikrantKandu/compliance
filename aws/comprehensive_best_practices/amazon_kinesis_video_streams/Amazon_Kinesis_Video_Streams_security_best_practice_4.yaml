    Title: Enable Server-Side Encryption for S3 Buckets
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
      to protect data at rest. This practice helps to secure sensitive data and comply
      with regulatory requirements.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data is
      encrypted before it is stored, protecting it from unauthorized access. Without
      encryption, data may be exposed to risks such as data breaches or unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Under the Default Encryption section, verify that server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the Properties tab and locate the Default Encryption section.
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) and save the
      changes.
