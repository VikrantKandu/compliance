  - Title: Enable Versioning on S3 Buckets
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that versioning is enabled on all S3 buckets to protect data
      from accidental deletion or overwriting. Versioning keeps multiple variants
      of an object in the same bucket, allowing you to restore previous versions when
      needed.
  - Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps in recovering from unintended
      user actions and application failures. Without versioning, data loss can occur
      due to accidental deletions or overwrites, which can have significant operational
      impacts.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Properties" tab. 4. Check if the "Versioning"
      status is "Enabled". 5. Repeat for all buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, versioning is disabled on S3 buckets.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket where versioning is not enabled. 4. Click on the "Properties"
      tab. 5. Under the "Versioning" section, click on "Enable Versioning". 6. Save
      changes.
