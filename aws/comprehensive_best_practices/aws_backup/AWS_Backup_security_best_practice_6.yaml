    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unintended
      parties, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure.
      By restricting public access, you minimize the risk of data leaks and ensure
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use the
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify the bucket policy status. 6. Check for the "Block Public Access" settings
      to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Edit the bucket policy
      and ACL to remove any public access permissions. 5. Enable "Block Public Access"
      settings for the bucket. 6. Save the changes to apply the new settings.
