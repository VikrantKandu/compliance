    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to data. It involves verifying that the bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Limiting access to only trusted users and services minimizes
      the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not include statements that allow public
      access.
    - Ensure that the bucket ACL does not grant public access or list "Everyone" or
      "Any authenticated AWS user" in the permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies that grant public access.
    - Adjust ACLs to ensure that they do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings from
      being applied to the bucket.
