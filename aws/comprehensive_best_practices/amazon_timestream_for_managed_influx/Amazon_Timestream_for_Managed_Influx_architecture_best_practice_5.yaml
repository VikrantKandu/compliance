    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFront Distributions Have Logging Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFront distributions have logging
      enabled to capture access logs for monitoring and auditing purposes. Enabling
      logging helps in tracking requests, analyzing traffic patterns, and identifying
      potential security incidents.
    Rationale: Enabling logging for CloudFront distributions is crucial for maintaining
      security and compliance. Without logging, it is challenging to perform forensic
      analysis in the event of a security incident, leading to potential data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Step 3: Select a distribution and choose the 'Distribution Settings' tab.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Logging' section to verify if logging is enabled.
    - Step 5: Ensure that an S3 bucket is specified for storing logs.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFront distributions do not have logging enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Step 3: Select the distribution for which you want to enable logging.
    - Step 4: Choose 'Edit' in the 'Distribution Settings' tab.
    - Step 5: In the 'Logging' section, select 'Enable Logging'.
    - Step 6: Specify an existing S3 bucket or create a new one to store the logs.
    - Step 7: Save the changes to enable logging for the distribution.
