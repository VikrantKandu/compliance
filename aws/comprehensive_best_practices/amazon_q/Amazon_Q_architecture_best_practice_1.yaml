    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of
      unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data stored
      in S3 buckets from unauthorized access. If not enabled, data may be exposed
      to unauthorized users if the bucket is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," choose "Enable."
    - Select the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption.
