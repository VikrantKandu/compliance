    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless
      explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized users. Publicly exposed buckets can lead to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for buckets that
      should not be publicly accessible.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
