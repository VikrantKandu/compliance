    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is critical to securing data
      stored in AWS. Public buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
