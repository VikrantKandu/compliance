  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security for accessing AWS resources. MFA
      requires users to present two or more separate forms of identification before
      gaining access, significantly reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA strengthens the security of user sign-in credentials by
      requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA, user accounts are
      more susceptible to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches or
      unauthorized actions within your AWS environment.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select Users. 4. Review each user to ensure that
      MFA is enabled. This can be verified by checking the 'MFA' column for each user
      entry, which should indicate whether MFA is activated.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      Authentication section, choose Activate MFA. 7. Follow the on-screen instructions
      to assign an MFA device to the user.
