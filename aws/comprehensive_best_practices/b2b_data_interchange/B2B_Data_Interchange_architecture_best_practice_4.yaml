  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured to do so.
  - Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy or ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
