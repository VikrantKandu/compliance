    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance with organizational
      policies.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities or non-compliant
      configurations into your environment. Approved AMIs are vetted for security,
      compliance, and performance, reducing the risk of exposure to security threats
      and ensuring consistency across deployments.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID of each instance against the list of approved AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any available AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Stop the instances and create snapshots of the volumes.
    - Launch new instances using approved AMIs.
    - Attach the existing volumes to the new instances if necessary.
    - Terminate the old instances using unapproved AMIs.
