    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket's settings
      to block all public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to only authorized
      users or roles.
