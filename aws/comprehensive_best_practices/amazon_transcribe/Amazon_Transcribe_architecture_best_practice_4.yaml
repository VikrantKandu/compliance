    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the root account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because the root account
      has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. Without MFA, the
      account is more vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches
      or misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA on the root account by selecting the "Security credentials"
      tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Activate MFA" and follow the steps to enable MFA using a virtual MFA
      device or a hardware MFA device.
