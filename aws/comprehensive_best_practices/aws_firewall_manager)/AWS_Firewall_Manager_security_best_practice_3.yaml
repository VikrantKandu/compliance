  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict access to
      sensitive data stored in S3 buckets to only those who need it.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Ensure there are no bucket policies or
      ACLs granting public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable
      "Block all public access" if not already enabled. 5. Review and modify any bucket
      policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
