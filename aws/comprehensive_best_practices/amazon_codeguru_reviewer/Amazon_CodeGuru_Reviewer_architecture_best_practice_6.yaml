    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to deny
      public access. Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access and data leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks by restricting
      access to authorized users only.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Public access" column.
    - For each bucket, ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
