    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires a second
      form of authentication beyond just a password, making unauthorized access more
      difficult.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to the AWS account. The root account has full access to all resources; thus,
      its compromise could lead to severe security breaches, data loss, or service
      disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) console.
    - Select "Users" and then the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM console.
    - Select the root account and choose "Manage MFA."
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA
      device.
