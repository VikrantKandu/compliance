  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access can lead to data breaches
      and exposure of confidential information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps
      secure data and comply with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that all public access is blocked. 5. Verify the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the non-compliant bucket. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to
      remove any public access permissions.
