    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not public reduces the risk
      of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for all buckets.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each
        bucket.
    - Step 5: Verify that bucket policies do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 5: Enable the 'Block all public access' setting.
    - Step 6: Review and modify bucket policies to remove public access permissions.
