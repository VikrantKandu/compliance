    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      public helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to update the bucket settings under 'Permissions'
      to disable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update the bucket ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
