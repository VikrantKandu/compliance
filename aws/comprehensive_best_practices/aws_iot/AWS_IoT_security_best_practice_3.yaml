    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets protects against accidental or
      malicious deletion and overwriting of objects by maintaining previous versions.
    Rationale: Versioning helps to recover from unintended user actions and application
      failures. Without versioning, data loss can occur, leading to compliance and
      security issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Check if "Versioning" is enabled under the "Bucket Versioning" section.
    Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket where you want to enable versioning.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Bucket Versioning," select "Enable versioning" and save changes.
