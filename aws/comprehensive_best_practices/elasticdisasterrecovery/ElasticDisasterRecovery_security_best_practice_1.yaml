    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of passwords, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to phishing attacks and credential theft, which can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized use of resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users." 4. Review the "MFA" column for each
      user to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user to check MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users" and choose the specific user.
      4. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Under "Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)," select "Manage" and follow the steps to enable MFA for the user.
