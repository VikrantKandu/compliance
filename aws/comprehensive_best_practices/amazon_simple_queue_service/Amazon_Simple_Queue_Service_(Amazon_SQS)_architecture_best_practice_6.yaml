    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access to S3 buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, posing a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches, compliance violations, and financial loss.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the "Public Access" column. 4. For each
      bucket, ensure that public access is blocked. You can also use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have all public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Under "Block public access (bucket settings)", click "Edit". 6. Ensure
      that all options to block public access are checked. 7. Save the changes to
      apply the new settings.
