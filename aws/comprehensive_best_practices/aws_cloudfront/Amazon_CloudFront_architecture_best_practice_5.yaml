    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires not only a
      password and username but also something that only the user has access to, such
      as a physical token or a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the AWS account, and if compromised, it could lead to severe data breaches
      and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Dashboard'.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Dashboard'.
    - In the 'Security Status' section, choose 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA using a virtual MFA device or
      hardware MFA device.
