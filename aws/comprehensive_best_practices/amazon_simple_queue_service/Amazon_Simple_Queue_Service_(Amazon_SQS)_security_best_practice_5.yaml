    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as sensitive
      information might be exposed to anyone on the internet. Ensuring buckets are
      private mitigates this risk.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure that no public
      access is granted. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check for 'AllUsers' or 'AuthenticatedUsers' permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket
      permissions to remove public access. 2. Update the bucket policy to restrict
      access to specific users or roles. 3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings
      to prevent future public access.
