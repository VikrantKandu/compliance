    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. It is crucial to ensure that sensitive
      data stored in S3 is only accessible to authorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they
      do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket that allows public access, enable the "Block all public access"
      setting.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
