    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access
      Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access
      to sensitive resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access, data breaches, and potential loss of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user. Ensure that all users have 'Assigned'
      status for MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user without MFA enabled.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, choose 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and configure an MFA device for the user.
