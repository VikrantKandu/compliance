    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leakage
      or unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to
      security breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access helps protect
      data and maintain privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the use case for public
      access.
    - If public access is not required, update the bucket's permissions to block public
      access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      public access.
