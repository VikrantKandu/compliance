    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can be granted
      through bucket policies or ACLs, and this check verifies that such configurations
      are not in place.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are
      private reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that all public access options are enabled to block any public access.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" under the bucket's settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
