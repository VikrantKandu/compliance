    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring not only a password but also a second form of verification. This
      helps protect user accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, an attacker only needs to obtain a user's password to gain access,
      which can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Step 4: Review the "MFA" column for each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Step 5: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-users` to list
        users, and `aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>` to verify MFA
        devices associated with each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Step 4: Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Step 5: In the "Security credentials" tab, choose "Manage MFA device".
    - Step 6: Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Step 7: Repeat the process for all IAM users.
