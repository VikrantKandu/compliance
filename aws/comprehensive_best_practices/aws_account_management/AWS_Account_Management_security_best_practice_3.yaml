    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an additional layer of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly strengthens security by requiring
      a second form of verification, which helps protect against compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized changes to AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check if 'MFA device'
      is assigned under the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. Verify that all users have
      an assigned MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Under the 'Security credentials' tab, choose 'Manage
      MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the
      user.
