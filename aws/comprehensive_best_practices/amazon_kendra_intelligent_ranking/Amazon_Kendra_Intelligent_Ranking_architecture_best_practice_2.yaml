    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are private
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket is publicly
        accessible.
    - Step 4: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the ACL settings.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check for any policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Step 2: Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Step 3: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings at both the account and bucket
        levels.
