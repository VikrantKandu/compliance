    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users with
      console access
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user sign-in credentials. With MFA enabled, users must provide both a password
      and a secondary authentication factor, such as a code from a mobile app or hardware
      device, to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, a compromised password could allow an attacker to access
      AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user with console access, check if MFA is enabled by selecting the
      user and reviewing the Security credentials tab.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
