    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      could lead to unauthorized access and data leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically check bucket policies for public
      access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to enforce restrictions and prevent accidental
      public exposure.
