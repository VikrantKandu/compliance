    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Ensure the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the account
        and bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable "Block Public Access" settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Action 2: Review and update bucket policies to restrict public access.
    - Action 3: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access
        to the buckets.
