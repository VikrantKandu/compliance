    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure proper network segmentation and security controls.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC allows for enhanced security by
      providing network isolation and the ability to use security groups and network
      ACLs. Instances outside a VPC may be exposed to security vulnerabilities and
      lack proper network control.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check all running instances and verify that they are associated with a VPC.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and review the output to
      ensure all instances have a VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched within a VPC if created
      using the AWS Management Console.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances not within a VPC.
    - Plan and execute a migration of these instances to a VPC.
    - Use the AWS VPC Wizard or AWS CLI to create a VPC if one does not exist.
    - Launch new instances within the VPC and decommission the non-compliant instances.
