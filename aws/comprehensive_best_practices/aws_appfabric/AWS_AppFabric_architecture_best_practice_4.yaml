    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data and maintaining privacy. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Check the bucket's Access Control List (ACL) settings to confirm that
        they do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access statements.
    - Step 5: Adjust the bucket's ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Step 6: Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future
        public access configurations.
