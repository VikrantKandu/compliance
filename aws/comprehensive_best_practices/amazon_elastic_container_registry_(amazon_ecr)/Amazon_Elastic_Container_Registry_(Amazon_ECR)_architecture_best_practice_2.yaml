    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data and pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access, data
      leakage, and potential data breaches. Restricting access to only required users
      and services minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and identify any with public access.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and policies to ensure they do not allow
      public access unless necessary.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - For any publicly accessible buckets, evaluate the necessity of public access.
    - If public access is not required, update the bucket policy and permissions to
      restrict access.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account
      level.
