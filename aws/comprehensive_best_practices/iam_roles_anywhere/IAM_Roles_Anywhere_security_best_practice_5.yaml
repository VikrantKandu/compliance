    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, which reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible protects
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' for all existing S3 buckets.
    - Review and update bucket policies and permissions to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
    - Implement IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users or services only.
