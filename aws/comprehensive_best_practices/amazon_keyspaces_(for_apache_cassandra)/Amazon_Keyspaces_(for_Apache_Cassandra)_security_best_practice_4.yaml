  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks. By default, S3 buckets allow
      public access, which can expose sensitive data to the internet if not properly
      configured.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
  - Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets and their
      permissions. Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for public
      access settings. Verify that no bucket allows public access unless explicitly
      required and documented.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are created with public access blocked,
      but this can be changed by users.
  - Remediation: If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy and ACL to restrict access. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI
      to apply a bucket policy that denies public access and ensure the block public
      access settings are enabled.
