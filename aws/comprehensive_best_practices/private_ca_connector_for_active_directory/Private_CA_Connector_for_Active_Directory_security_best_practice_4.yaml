  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized users. Unrestricted access can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and financial loss.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a policy allowing public access or an ACL
      granting public read/write permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not accessible to the public.
  - Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings at the bucket level to ensure no future
      public access is granted.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with best practices.
