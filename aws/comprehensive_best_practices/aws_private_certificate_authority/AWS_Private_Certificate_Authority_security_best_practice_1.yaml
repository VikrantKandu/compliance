    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using the latest AMIs helps to ensure that
      instances have the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs may expose instances to known vulnerabilities and
      security risks. Regularly updating AMIs helps maintain the security and stability
      of the instances.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID in use.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest AMI ID available in the AWS Marketplace or
      your custom AMIs.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with older AMIs if not regularly updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance once migration is complete.
