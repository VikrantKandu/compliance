    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. Ensuring that buckets are private
      mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data loss or theft.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Verify that no bucket
      has public access enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket ACLs programmatically. 6. Use the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Remove any public access
      permissions from the bucket policy or ACL. 5. Enable Block Public Access settings
      to prevent future public access configurations. 6. Review and update the bucket
      policy to ensure it does not grant public access.
