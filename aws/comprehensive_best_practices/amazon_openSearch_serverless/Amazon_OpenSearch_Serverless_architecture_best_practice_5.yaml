    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access. Public buckets can be exploited by attackers to access
      or modify data without proper authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review its permissions.
    - Ensure that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use IAM policies to provide specific access permissions to authorized users
      or services.
