    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are built on a secure, tested,
      and compliant baseline. Unapproved AMIs could contain vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
      that pose security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each running instance, verify the AMI ID in use.
    - Cross-reference the AMI ID with the list of approved AMIs maintained by your
      organization.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with any publicly available AMI by default.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Plan and execute a migration strategy to launch these instances using approved
      AMIs.
    - Update deployment processes to enforce the use of approved AMIs for future instances.
