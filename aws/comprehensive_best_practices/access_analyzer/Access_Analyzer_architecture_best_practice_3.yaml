    Title: Enable Server-Side Encryption (SSE) for S3 Buckets
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets have Server-Side Encryption (SSE) enabled
      to protect data at rest. SSE encrypts data before storing it and decrypts it
      when retrieved, providing an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling SSE helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
      and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Without SSE, data stored
      in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized access and breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each S3 bucket, go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Default encryption' section to verify if SSE is enabled.
    - Step 5: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
        --bucket <bucket-name>` to check the SSE status.
    Default Value: Disabled
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the S3 bucket that does not have SSE enabled.
    - Step 4: Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Step 5: In the 'Default encryption' section, click 'Edit'.
    - Step 6: Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C).
    - Step 7: Click 'Save' to apply the changes.
