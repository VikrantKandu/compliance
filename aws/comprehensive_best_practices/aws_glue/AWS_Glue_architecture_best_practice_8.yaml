    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication factor
      beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account adds an extra layer of security, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access. The root account has full access to all resources
      in the AWS account, and a compromised root account can lead to severe security
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Dashboard".
    - Step 4: Verify that the "MFA on your root account" status is "Enabled".
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Dashboard".
    - Step 4: Under "Security Status", choose "Activate MFA on your root account".
    - Step 5: Follow the prompts to complete the MFA setup process.
