    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data
      exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access. Limiting public access reduces
      the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if not already enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access
      unless explicitly required.
