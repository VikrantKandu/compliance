    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such
      as a code from a mobile device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is compromised, the attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Review each user to ensure that
      MFA is enabled. This can be done by checking the "MFA" column for each user.
      5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
      verify which users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select the "Users" tab and click on the specific user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 4. In the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage
      MFA device". 5. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device
      to the user. 6. Repeat these steps for each user without MFA enabled.
