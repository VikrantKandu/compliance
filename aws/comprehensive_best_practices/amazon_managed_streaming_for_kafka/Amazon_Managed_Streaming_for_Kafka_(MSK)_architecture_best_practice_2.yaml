  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>
      to verify the ACL settings.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
