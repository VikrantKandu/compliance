    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets could lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and security breaches. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and comply with security
      policies.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of S3 buckets and check the bucket policies and permissions.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policies do not grant public access.
    - Step 5: Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each
        bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the S3 bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Edit the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Step 5: Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Step 6: Review and update IAM policies to ensure they do not allow public access
        to the bucket.
