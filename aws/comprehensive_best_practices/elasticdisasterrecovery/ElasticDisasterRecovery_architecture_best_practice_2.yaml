  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. This involves checking bucket policies and ACLs to confirm that
      they do not permit public access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      sensitive data exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket policies and ACLs for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Confirm that no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME
        to verify ACL settings.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
        BUCKET_NAME to check bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Step 3: Edit the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Step 4: Adjust the ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Step 5: Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
