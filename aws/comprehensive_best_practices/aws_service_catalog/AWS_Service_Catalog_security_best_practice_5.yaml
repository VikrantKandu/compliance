    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information, posing security and compliance risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and configure "Block public access" settings to
      block all public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
