    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      S3 buckets should be configured to restrict public access to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks and helps maintain data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List" (ACL) settings.
    - Verify that no public access permissions are granted.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and aws s3api
        get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but explicit policies or ACL
      changes can make them public.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, remove public access by updating the bucket
      policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to enable "Block all public access" setting.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and use AWS Config Rules to monitor public
      access settings.
