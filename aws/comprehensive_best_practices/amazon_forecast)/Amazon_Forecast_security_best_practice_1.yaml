    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on
      top of a password, requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      the attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA mitigates this
      risk by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column. 5. Verify that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Choose the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Assigned
      MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device
      to the user.
