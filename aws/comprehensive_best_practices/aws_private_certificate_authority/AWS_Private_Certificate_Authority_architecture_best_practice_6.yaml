    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      protects data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with public access settings.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab and review the 'Block public access'
      settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the permissions tab and click on 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      no public access is granted.
