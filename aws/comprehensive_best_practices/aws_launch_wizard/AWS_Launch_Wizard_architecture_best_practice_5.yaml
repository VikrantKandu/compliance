    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public accessibility of S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy does not allow
      public access.
    - Check the bucket's access control list (ACL) to verify it does not permit public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any S3 buckets that are publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Modify the bucket's ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
