    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any indication of
      public access.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block public access settings.
    - Ensure that the Block all public access setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block public access settings and enable the Block all public access
      option.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
