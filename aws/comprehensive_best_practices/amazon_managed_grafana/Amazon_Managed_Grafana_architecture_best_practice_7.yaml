    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access. Instances should be accessible only through
      secure channels such as VPN or bastion hosts.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible EC2 instances can lead to unauthorized access,
      data breaches, and exploitation by malicious actors. Limiting access reduces
      the attack surface and enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the security groups associated with each EC2 instance.
    - Verify that no security group allows inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 on ports
      other than those required for specific applications.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are publicly accessible if security groups allow
      inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Identify the security groups associated with publicly accessible instances.
    - Modify the security groups to restrict inbound traffic to known IP addresses
      or ranges.
    - Use VPNs or bastion hosts for secure access to instances.
