    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets mitigates the risk of data exposure
      in case of unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in
      S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties for server-side encryption settings.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the properties of the bucket.
    - Enable server-side encryption with the desired encryption key (e.g., AES-256
      or AWS-KMS).
