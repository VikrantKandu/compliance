    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are private by default, preventing
      unauthorized access to the data stored within.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default helps protect sensitive data
      from being exposed to the public internet. Misconfigured S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public read or write access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to set the bucket to private.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement a bucket policy that denies public access.
