    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be enabled for all AWS IAM
      users to provide an additional layer of security for user sign-in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps to secure AWS accounts by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication in addition to their password. This reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access in case of compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled by looking for the 'MFA Device'
      attribute.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Click on each user and select 'Security credentials'.
    - Click 'Manage' next to the 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the steps to enable
      MFA for the user.
