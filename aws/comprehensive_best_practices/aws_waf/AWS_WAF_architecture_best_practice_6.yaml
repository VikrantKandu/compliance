    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet.
      Restricting access helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions of each bucket to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the affected S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings.
