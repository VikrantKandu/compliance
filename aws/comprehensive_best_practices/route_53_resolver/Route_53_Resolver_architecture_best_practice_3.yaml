    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block
        Public Access' settings are enabled.
    - Step 4: Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow
        public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy'
        to programmatically check permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 3: Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Step 4: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI to apply changes if needed, using commands like 'aws
        s3api put-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api put-bucket-policy'.
