    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      required. Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Limiting access to only trusted entities helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions under the Permissions tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
