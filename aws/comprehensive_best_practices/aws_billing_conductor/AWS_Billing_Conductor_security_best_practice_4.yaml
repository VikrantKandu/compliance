    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to
      gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances account security by requiring additional
      verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing and credential theft.
    Audit: To verify compliance, use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list
      all IAM users and check if MFA is enabled. In the console, go to the IAM dashboard,
      select 'Users', and review the 'MFA' column to ensure MFA is enabled for each
      user. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by
      'aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>' for each user to confirm MFA
      devices are configured.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: To enable MFA for IAM users, navigate to the IAM dashboard in the
      AWS Management Console. Select the user, choose 'Security credentials', and
      assign a virtual or hardware MFA device. Follow the on-screen instructions to
      configure the MFA device.
