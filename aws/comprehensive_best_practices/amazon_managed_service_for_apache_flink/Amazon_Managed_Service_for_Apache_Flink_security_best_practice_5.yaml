    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access
      to secure systems.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the AWS account, making it a prime target for attackers. Without MFA, a compromised
      password could lead to a full account takeover.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Dashboard" option.
    - Check the "Security Status" section for MFA on the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is listed as "Enabled" for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the "Dashboard" section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the steps to set up a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Verify the configuration by logging out and logging back in using MFA.
