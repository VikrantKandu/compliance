    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users in your AWS account
      to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two or more
      authentication factors, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring additional verification
      beyond just a password. This mitigates the risk of unauthorized access due to
      stolen or leaked credentials, protecting sensitive resources and data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user name to view its details.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users without MFA enabled.
