  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private.
      By default, S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access and data leaks.
  - Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive information and lead to compliance issues.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Check for any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACLs programmatically.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDKs to update bucket settings programmatically if necessary.
