    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account, requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a physical device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against the unauthorized use
      of compromised credentials. Without MFA, a malicious actor with access to a
      user's credentials could potentially gain access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user you want to enable MFA for.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
