    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all data stored in Amazon S3 buckets is encrypted to
      protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest in S3 buckets helps protect it from unauthorized
      access and meets compliance requirements. Without encryption, data is vulnerable
      to breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the default encryption settings.
    - Verify that SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted unless specified during
      creation.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Go to the Properties tab.
    - Under the Default Encryption section, choose Edit.
    - Select the desired encryption method (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C) and save the
      changes.
