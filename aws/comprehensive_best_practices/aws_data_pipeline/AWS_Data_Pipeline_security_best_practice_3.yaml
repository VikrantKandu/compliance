    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an additional layer of security beyond
      just a username and password. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, which could lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device.
