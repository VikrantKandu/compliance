    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security to your AWS
      account by requiring not only a password and username but also something that
      only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a smartphone app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      account access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Review the "MFA" column for each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
