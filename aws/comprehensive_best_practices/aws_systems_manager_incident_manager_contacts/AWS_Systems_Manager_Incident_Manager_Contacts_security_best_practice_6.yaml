    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets may lead to data exposure and
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Review the Access Control List (ACL) to verify that 'Everyone' does not have
      read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Disable any public access settings.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for fine-grained
      access control.
