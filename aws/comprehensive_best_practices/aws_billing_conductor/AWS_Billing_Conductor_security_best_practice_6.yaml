  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead
      to sensitive data being exposed to the internet, which could result in data
      breaches or unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to anyone on the internet. Ensuring that buckets
      are private can prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to check.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block public access" settings are enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure that it does not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
