    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks,
      unauthorized access, and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet.
      By restricting public access, you reduce the risk of data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and remove any public access settings or policies.
    - Apply a bucket policy or access control list (ACL) to restrict access as needed.
