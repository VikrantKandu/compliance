  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access and that the ACLs
      do not allow public reads or writes.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACL settings to ensure no public read or write permissions are granted.
    - Consider enabling block public access settings for the bucket to prevent future
      public access configurations.
