    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional verification
      beyond just a password. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users
      to protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, the attacker
      can gain full access to the AWS account. MFA provides an additional barrier
      that can prevent unauthorized access even if the password is known.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Check the 'MFA enabled' column for each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
