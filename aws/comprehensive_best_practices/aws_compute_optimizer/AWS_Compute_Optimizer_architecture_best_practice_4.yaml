    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not have public
      access settings enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, organizations can protect
      sensitive data from being exposed to the internet. Public buckets can lead to
      data breaches, compliance violations, and financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL)
      settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket's ACL and bucket policy settings.
    - Remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
