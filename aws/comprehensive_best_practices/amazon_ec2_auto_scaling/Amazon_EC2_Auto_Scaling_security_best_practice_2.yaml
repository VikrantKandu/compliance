    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      multiple forms of identification before accessing an account, significantly
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS
      account. If compromised, it could lead to severe security breaches. Enabling
      MFA adds an additional layer of security, making it harder for attackers to
      gain access even if they have the password.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Dashboard' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - In the 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA is enabled by logging out and logging back in using the MFA
      device.
