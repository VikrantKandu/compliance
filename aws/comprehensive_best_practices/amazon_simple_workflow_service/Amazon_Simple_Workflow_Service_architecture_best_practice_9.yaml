    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check the bucket access control list.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 5: Edit the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Step 6: Update the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Step 7: Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
