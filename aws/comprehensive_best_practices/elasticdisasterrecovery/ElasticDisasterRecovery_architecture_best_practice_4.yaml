  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that no bucket has "Public"
      access enabled in the permissions settings. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings programmatically.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the Permissions tab. 5. Block
      all public access by adjusting the settings. 6. Save changes and verify the
      bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
