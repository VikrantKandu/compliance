    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and should be restricted
      to authorized users only.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
