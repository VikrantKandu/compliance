    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to the authentication
      process, reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA Device' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', select 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
