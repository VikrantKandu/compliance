    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account enhances security by requiring a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if the root
      account password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click on 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the instructions to set up and activate MFA for the root account.
