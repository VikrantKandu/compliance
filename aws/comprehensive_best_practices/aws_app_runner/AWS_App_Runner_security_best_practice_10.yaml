  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the permissions tab. 4. Verify that the bucket
      does not have public access permissions. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check the ACL settings for public access.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket policy for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the permissions tab and remove
      any public access permissions. 5. Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict
      access. 6. Use the AWS CLI to remove any public access settings with aws s3api
      delete-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
