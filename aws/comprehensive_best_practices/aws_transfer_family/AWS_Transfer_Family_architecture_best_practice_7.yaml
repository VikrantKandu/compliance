    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      unauthorized data access. Public access can lead to data exposure, compliance
      violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings
      to ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not publicly accessible by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Review and update any IAM policies that grant public access to the bucket.
