    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
