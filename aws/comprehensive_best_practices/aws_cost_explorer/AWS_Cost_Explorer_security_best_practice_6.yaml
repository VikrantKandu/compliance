    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against the unauthorized use
      of AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, there is a higher risk of account compromise
      through credential theft or brute force attacks.
    Audit: To verify compliance, list all IAM users and check the MFA status for each
      user. Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to retrieve the list
      of IAM users and their MFA device status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation: Enable MFA for each IAM user by assigning a virtual MFA device or
      hardware MFA device. This can be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS
      CLI, or AWS SDKs. Ensure users configure MFA devices and verify their setup.
