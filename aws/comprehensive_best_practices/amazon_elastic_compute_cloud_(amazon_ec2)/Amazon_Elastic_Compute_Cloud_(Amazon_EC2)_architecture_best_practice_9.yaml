    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive information
      and reduces the risk of data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and bucket policies for each bucket. 4. Ensure
      that there are no public access permissions granted to the bucket. 5. Verify
      that the bucket policies do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Remove any public
      access permissions from the bucket. 5. Update the bucket policy to restrict
      public access. 6. Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for the
      account or specific buckets.
