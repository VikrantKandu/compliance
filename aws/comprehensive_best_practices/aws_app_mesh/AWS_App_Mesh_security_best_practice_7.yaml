    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all Regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all AWS regions to provide
      a comprehensive log of all API calls made within your AWS account. This helps
      in auditing and monitoring activities across your AWS infrastructure.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that you have a complete
      record of all API activity in your account, which is crucial for security analysis,
      resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. Without CloudTrail, you may
      miss critical security events or unauthorized access attempts.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that there is at least one trail configured to log events in all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is logging both management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is configured to log both management and data events.
    - Save the configuration changes.
