    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access to resources, which significantly
      reduces the risk of account compromise.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is critical because the root account
      has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. If compromised,
      an attacker could gain full control over the account, leading to potential data
      breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled on the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device.
