    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict access
      to only those who require it.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible protects against accidental data exposure and potential
      security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" on the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      only authorized users and services.
