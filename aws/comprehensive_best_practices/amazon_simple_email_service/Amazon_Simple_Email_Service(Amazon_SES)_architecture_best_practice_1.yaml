    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Regularly update EC2 instances to use the latest Amazon Machine Images
      (AMIs) to ensure they include the latest security patches and updates. This
      practice helps maintain the security and stability of the instances by protecting
      against vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to known vulnerabilities that
      have been addressed in newer versions. Regularly updating ensures that instances
      benefit from security enhancements and bug fixes, reducing the risk of exploitation.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances and check the AMI ID used by each instance. 4. Compare the
      AMI ID with the latest available AMI in the AWS Marketplace or your custom AMI
      catalog. 5. Verify that the instances are using the latest AMI version.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with outdated AMIs if not regularly updated.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances running outdated AMIs. 2. Plan for a maintenance
      window to update the AMIs. 3. Create new instances using the latest AMI version.
      4. Test the new instances to ensure they function as expected. 5. Replace the
      old instances with the new ones to complete the update process.
