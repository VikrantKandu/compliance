    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to enhance security and network management. Operating within a VPC allows
      for better control over network configurations and security settings.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides enhanced security through
      network isolation and control over inbound and outbound traffic. Instances outside
      a VPC lack these protections, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the list of running instances.
    - Verify that each instance is associated with a VPC ID.
    - If any instance is not within a VPC, it is non-compliant.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances should be launched within a VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances not within a VPC.
    - Plan and execute a migration of these instances to a VPC.
    - Update instance configurations to ensure they are launched within a VPC in the
      future.
