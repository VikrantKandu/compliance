    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are launched with IAM roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should be launched with IAM roles to ensure secure
      access to AWS services and resources without embedding credentials in applications.
    Rationale: Using IAM roles for EC2 instances reduces the risk of credential exposure
      and simplifies the management of permissions. Without IAM roles, credentials
      might be hardcoded in applications, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. Review each instance to check
      if an IAM role is associated. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances
      and check the IamInstanceProfile field for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched without an IAM role unless
      specified during instance creation.
    Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances without IAM roles. 2. Create an IAM role
      with the necessary permissions. 3. Associate the IAM role with the EC2 instance
      by stopping the instance, attaching the role, and then restarting the instance.
