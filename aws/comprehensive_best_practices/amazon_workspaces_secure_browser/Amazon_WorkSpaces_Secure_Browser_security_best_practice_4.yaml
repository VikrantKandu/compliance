    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using IAM Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all EC2 instances are using IAM roles to manage permissions.
      This ensures that temporary credentials are used instead of embedding long-term
      access keys within the instance.
    Rationale: Using IAM roles for EC2 instances enhances security by managing permissions
      centrally and avoiding the risk of leaking long-term credentials. Without IAM
      roles, there's a higher risk of credential exposure and potential unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the IAM Role column to ensure an IAM role is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the IamInstanceProfile attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role assigned.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the IAM role that provides the necessary permissions for the instance's
      applications.
    - Assign the IAM role to the EC2 instance by stopping the instance, attaching
      the role, and then restarting the instance.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile
      to attach an IAM role to the instance without stopping it.
