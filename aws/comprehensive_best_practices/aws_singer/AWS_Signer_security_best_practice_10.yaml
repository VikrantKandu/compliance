    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by
      requiring an additional form of verification during sign-in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, even if login credentials are compromised. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing or brute force.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam list-mfa-devices' for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for each IAM user without MFA enabled.
