    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and ACL do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the ACL settings. 6. Use the
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACL.
      2. Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to modify permissions. 3. Implement
      bucket policies that restrict access to specific IAM roles or users. 4. Enable
      S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
