    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized exposure. Public buckets can lead to data breaches and
      compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access settings enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block Public Access settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Save changes to apply the updated settings.
