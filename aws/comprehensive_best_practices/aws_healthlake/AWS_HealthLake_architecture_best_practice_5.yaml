    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS
      account. If compromised, it can lead to severe security breaches, including
      data loss and unauthorized resource manipulation. Enabling MFA significantly
      mitigates the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the
      root user. 5. Verify if MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA Device' column for
      the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the
      root user. 5. Choose 'Manage MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to enable and configure
      MFA for the root account.
