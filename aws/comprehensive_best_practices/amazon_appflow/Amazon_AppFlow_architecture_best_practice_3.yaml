    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public read or write
      access, which can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the permissions for each bucket to ensure no public access is
        granted.
    - Step 4: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>'
        to verify ACL settings.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
        to check bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Remove any 'AllUsers' or 'AuthenticatedUsers' permissions from the
        bucket ACL.
    - Action 2: Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public
        access.
    - Action 3: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
