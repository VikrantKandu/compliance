    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can
      lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can
      prevent unauthorized data access and mitigate the risk of data breaches. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive data and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and check the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that 'Block all
      public access' settings are enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policy or ACL
      grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to S3. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable
      'Block all public access'. 4. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs
      that grant public access to ensure they do not allow public access.
