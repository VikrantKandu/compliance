    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide an additional authentication factor
      beyond their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of user accounts by preventing unauthorized
      access even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to phishing attacks and other security threats.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select each user and check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS
      CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled
      and aws iam list-users to compare against all users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 5. Click on the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Assigned
      MFA device', click on 'Manage'. 7. Choose the type of MFA device and follow
      the instructions to enable it.
