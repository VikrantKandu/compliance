    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a username and password by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if credentials are compromised, attackers
      can gain full access to the account, leading to potential data breaches and
      unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and check for MFA
        devices using aws iam list-mfa-devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select "Users."
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage MFA."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
    - Instruct the user to configure their MFA device using a supported authenticator
      application.
