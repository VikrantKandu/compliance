    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance security
      by requiring an additional authentication factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: MFA provides an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access in case of compromised credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks such as phishing or credential stuffing.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user name.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA.
