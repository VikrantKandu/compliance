    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled to protect
      data at rest. This ensures that the data stored in S3 is encrypted using AWS
      managed keys or customer-provided keys.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
      access. If encryption is not enabled, data could be exposed in the event of
      a security breach or misconfiguration.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Check the "Default encryption" section to verify that encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and find the "Default encryption" section.
    - Enable server-side encryption with either AWS managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer-provided
      keys (SSE-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
