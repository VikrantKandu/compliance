    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default minimizes the risk of data breaches
      by ensuring that only authorized users have access. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to exposure of sensitive information and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the access control list does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but existing buckets may
      have different settings.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for each S3 bucket in the AWS Management
      Console.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure they do not grant
      public access.
