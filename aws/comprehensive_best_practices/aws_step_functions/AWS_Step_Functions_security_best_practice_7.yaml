    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a password by requiring a second
      form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially in the event of compromised passwords. Without MFA, user accounts
      are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that all users have an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user you want to enable MFA for.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and select 'Manage' under 'MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
