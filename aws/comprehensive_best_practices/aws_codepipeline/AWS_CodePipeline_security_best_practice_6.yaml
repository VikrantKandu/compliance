    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to ensure that sensitive data is not exposed to the internet. It is important
      to configure S3 bucket permissions correctly to protect data from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of exposing data to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to check bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to update the bucket settings.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI commands to update the bucket policy and ACLs to
      ensure no public access is allowed.
