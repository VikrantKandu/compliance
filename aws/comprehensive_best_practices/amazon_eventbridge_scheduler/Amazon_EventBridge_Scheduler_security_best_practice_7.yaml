    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to an account,
      making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is critical because the root account
      has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. Without MFA, if
      the root account credentials are compromised, an attacker could potentially
      access and manipulate all resources, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the root account and check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
    - Confirm MFA is enabled by attempting to log in with the root account and verifying
      the MFA prompt appears.
