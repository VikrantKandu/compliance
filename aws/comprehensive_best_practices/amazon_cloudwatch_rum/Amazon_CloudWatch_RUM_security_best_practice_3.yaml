    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select each bucket and review its permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Disable any public access settings in the bucket's ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings at both the account and bucket levels
      to prevent any future public access.
