    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance types
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest generation
      instance types to benefit from improved performance, security features, and
      cost efficiency.
    Rationale: Using the latest generation instance types provides enhanced performance,
      better security features, and cost savings. Older generation instances may lack
      support for new features and can lead to higher costs and potential security
      vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Review the list of running instances and their instance types.
    - Compare the instance types with the latest generation available in the AWS EC2
      documentation.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest generation instance
      types unless explicitly specified during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances running on older generation instance types.
    - Plan and execute an upgrade to the latest generation instance types, considering
      compatibility and performance requirements.
    - Update any associated scripts or automation tools to specify the latest generation
      instance types.
