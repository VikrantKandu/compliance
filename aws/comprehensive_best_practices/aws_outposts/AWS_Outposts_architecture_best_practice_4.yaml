    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL).
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the ACL.
    - Utilize the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent accidental public
      access configurations.
