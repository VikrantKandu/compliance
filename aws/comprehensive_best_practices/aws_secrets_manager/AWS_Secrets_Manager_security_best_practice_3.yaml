    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure
      and potential security breaches.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
      Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the access control settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access unless necessary.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to programmatically
      check the ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless the access settings are
      modified to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible without a valid reason, update
      the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings.
    - Ensure that only specific users or services have access to the bucket as required.
