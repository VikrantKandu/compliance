    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access to only authorized users
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for any bucket marked
      as "Public".
    - For each public bucket, review the bucket policies and access control lists
      (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
