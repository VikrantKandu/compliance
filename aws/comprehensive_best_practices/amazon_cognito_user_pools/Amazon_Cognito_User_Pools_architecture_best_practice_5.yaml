  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand, such as a physical token or a phone app.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts, as attackers would need both the user's credentials and the MFA device
      to gain access. Without MFA, unauthorized access could lead to data breaches,
      resource manipulation, and other security incidents.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM console.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list all users and their MFA status.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      console. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage
      MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
