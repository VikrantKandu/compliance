    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default
      helps to protect sensitive data and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, immediately update the bucket
      permissions.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and remove any public access policies attached to the bucket.
