    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, in
      addition to their password, to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access and potentially harmful actions within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list users and
      aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <UserName> to check MFA devices associated
      with each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
