    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, security, and compliance with
      organizational policies.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances have the necessary security
      patches, configurations, and compliance settings. Unapproved AMIs may have vulnerabilities
      or misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID of each instance against the list of approved AMIs.
    - Confirm that all instances are using an AMI from the approved list.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Create a backup of the instance data if necessary.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Restore data to the new instance if needed.
