    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. By default, S3 buckets should
      have access permissions that restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect against data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow
      public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically check bucket policies:
      - Command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      - Verify that the policy status is not public.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove public access.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
