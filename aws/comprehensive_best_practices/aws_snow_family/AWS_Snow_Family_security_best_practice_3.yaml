    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure.
      Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leaks. This check is recommended to protect sensitive data stored
      in S3.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to review bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the ACL to ensure that only authorized users have access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
