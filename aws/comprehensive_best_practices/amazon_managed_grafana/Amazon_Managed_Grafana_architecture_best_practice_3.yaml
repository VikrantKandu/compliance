    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Check the "Block all public access" setting for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
