  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which means that unauthorized users cannot access the data stored in these buckets.
      It is crucial to safeguard sensitive information and comply with data protection
      regulations.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      minimizes the risk of data exposure and potential compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each S3 bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Confirm that the bucket's access control
      list (ACL) is not set to public.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Open the S3 console in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select the
      bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions. 4. Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure it
      is not set to public. 5. Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to
      prevent future public access.
