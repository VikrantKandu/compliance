    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS services. Enabling MFA for all Identity and Access Management
      (IAM) users helps protect against unauthorized access, even if a password is
      compromised.
    Rationale: Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data breaches or service disruptions.
      MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
