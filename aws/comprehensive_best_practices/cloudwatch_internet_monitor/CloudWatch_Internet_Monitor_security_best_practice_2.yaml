    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for AWS accounts by requiring users to enter a unique authentication code from
      an MFA device in addition to their password. This check ensures that MFA is
      enabled for all IAM users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to compromise if passwords
      are stolen or guessed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI to list users and check MFA status by running: aws
        iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each
        user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI to enable MFA by running: aws iam enable-mfa-device
        with the appropriate parameters.
