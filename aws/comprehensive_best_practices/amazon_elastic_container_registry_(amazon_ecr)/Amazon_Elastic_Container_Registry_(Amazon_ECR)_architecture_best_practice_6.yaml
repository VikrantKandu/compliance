    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may change.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Under the "Permissions" tab, enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
