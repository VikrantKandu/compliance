    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS accounts by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This practice helps protect against unauthorized access
      in the event that a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the user's permissions, potentially leading
      to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select 'Manage MFA Device' under the 'Security Credentials'
      tab.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate a virtual or hardware MFA device for
      the user.
