- rule:
  - ID: AWS-S3-01
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      By default, S3 buckets should be private to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private reduces this risk.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policies do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict access. 2. Use the AWS Management Console to adjust permissions. 3.
      Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> --policy file://policy.json to apply a restrictive policy.
