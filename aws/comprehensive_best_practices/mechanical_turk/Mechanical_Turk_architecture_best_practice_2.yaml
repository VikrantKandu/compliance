  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By restricting public access, you can protect
      your data from unauthorized users and potential attackers.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
      service. 3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Ensure that the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Verify
      that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the Amazon S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly
      accessible. 3. Review the bucket policy and ACL, and remove any statements that
      allow public access. 4. Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket
      to prevent future public access configurations.
