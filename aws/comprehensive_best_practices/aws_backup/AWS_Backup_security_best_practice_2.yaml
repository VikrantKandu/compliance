    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed to the internet. Restricting access to only authorized
      users mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public
      access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) granting
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket permissions settings.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure no public access is
      granted.
