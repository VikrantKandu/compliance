    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can expose instances to unnecessary risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to security vulnerabilities
      as it allows unrestricted access. This can result in unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with the necessary inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Ensure the default security group is not assigned to any instances.
