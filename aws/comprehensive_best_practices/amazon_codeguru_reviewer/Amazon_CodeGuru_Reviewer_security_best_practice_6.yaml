    Title: Ensure EC2 Security Groups Do Not Allow Unrestricted Inbound Access
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Security Groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances
      to control inbound and outbound traffic. It is crucial to ensure that Security
      Groups do not allow unrestricted inbound access, particularly to sensitive ports
      like SSH (22) and RDP (3389).
    Rationale: Allowing unrestricted inbound access poses a significant security risk
      as it can expose your instances to potential attacks from any IP address. Restricting
      access to specific IP addresses reduces the attack surface and enhances security.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, click on 'Security Groups'. 4. Review each Security
      Group's inbound rules. 5. Ensure that there are no rules allowing traffic from
      0.0.0.0/0 unless absolutely necessary and justified.
    Default Value: By default, Security Groups may allow unrestricted access if not
      configured properly during creation.
    Remediation: 1. Identify the Security Group with unrestricted inbound access.
      2. Edit the inbound rules of the Security Group. 3. Remove or modify rules that
      allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. 4. Add rules to allow traffic only from specific
      IP addresses or CIDR blocks that require access.
