    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide two or more verification factors to gain access to resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. It is an essential security measure to protect sensitive
      data and infrastructure from compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Users' section.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled. This can be verified by checking
      the 'MFA device' column for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Users' section and choose a user.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Manage' and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA for the user.
