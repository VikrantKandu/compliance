    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users but are instead attached to groups or roles. Attaching policies
      to groups or roles simplifies management and reduces the risk of excessive permissions.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures and increase the risk of granting excessive privileges. By using
      groups or roles, permissions are easier to manage and audit, reducing the potential
      for security breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Verify that no policies are directly attached to users and that permissions
      are granted through group memberships or roles.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation: 1. Identify users with directly attached policies. 2. Create or identify
      appropriate groups or roles that match the user's permissions. 3. Attach the
      policies to the groups or roles. 4. Add users to the groups or assign roles
      to users. 5. Detach the policies from the users.
