    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in the AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the
      user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have
      immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are
      compromised, an attacker could gain access to AWS resources, leading to potential
      data loss or service disruption.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and select 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
