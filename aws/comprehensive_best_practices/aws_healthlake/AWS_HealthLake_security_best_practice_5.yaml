    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFormation stacks have encryption
      enabled to protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption for CloudFormation stacks helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption, data
      may be vulnerable to interception or unauthorized disclosure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select a stack and check the stack settings to verify if encryption is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws cloudformation describe-stacks to programmatically check
      the encryption status of stacks.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stacks are not encrypted unless specified.
    Remediation:
    - Update the CloudFormation template to include encryption settings.
    - Enable encryption for existing stacks by modifying the stack settings.
    - Ensure future stacks have encryption enabled by default during creation.
