    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL for any public grants.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for any public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
