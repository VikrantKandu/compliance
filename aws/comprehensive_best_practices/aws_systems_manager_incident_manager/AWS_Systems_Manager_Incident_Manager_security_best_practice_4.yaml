    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users adds
      an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password but also a second
      form of verification to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts by requiring
      additional verification, thus protecting sensitive data and resources from unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the "Security credentials" tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Users" section and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab and click "Manage" in the "Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)" section.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
