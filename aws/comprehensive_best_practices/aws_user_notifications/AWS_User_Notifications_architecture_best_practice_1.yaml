    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and
      ACL settings do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify bucket policies
      and ACLs programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Console or CLI to apply the necessary changes to the bucket permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent any future public
      access configurations.
