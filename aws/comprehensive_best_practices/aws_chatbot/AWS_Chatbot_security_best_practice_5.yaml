    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, which helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps mitigate the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is stolen or guessed, an attacker could
      gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA adds a security barrier by requiring
      a second factor that is not easily compromised.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by selecting the user and looking under
      the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all IAM users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
