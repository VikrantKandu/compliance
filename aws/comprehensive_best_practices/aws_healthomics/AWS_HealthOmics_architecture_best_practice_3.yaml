    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access, which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any indication of
      public access.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open the bucket details.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and ensure that the Block Public Access settings are
      enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable Block all public access settings.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
