    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public access can lead
      to exposure of confidential information, financial loss, and damage to organizational
      reputation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block public access" settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access."
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
