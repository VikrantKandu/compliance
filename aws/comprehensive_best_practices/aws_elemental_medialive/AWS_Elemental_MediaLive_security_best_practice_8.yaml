    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in AWS S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS Config to check the bucket's public access
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature in S3 settings.
    - Review and adjust the ACLs to ensure only authorized users have access.
