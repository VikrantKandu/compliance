    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound access by default.
      It is important to use custom security groups to enforce stricter access controls.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      all inbound traffic by default. This could lead to unauthorized access to your
      instances and compromise the security of your applications and data.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. Check the security group associated
      with each instance. 5. Verify that no instance is using the default security
      group.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are launched with the default security group unless
      specified otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with the necessary inbound and outbound rules. 3. Associate
      the new security group with the instances. 4. Remove the default security group
      association from the instances.
