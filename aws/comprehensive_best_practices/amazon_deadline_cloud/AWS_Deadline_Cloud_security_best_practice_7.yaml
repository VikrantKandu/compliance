    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an extra layer of security. MFA requires the user to
      present two or more separate forms of identification, which significantly reduces
      the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in an AWS
      account. If the root account credentials are compromised, an attacker can potentially
      cause significant damage. Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security,
      making unauthorized access more difficult.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users and then choose the root account.
    - Check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users and then choose the root account.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, select Activate MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device, U2F security key,
      or another supported method.
