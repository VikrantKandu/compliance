    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all newly created S3 buckets are private
      by default to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. It is crucial
      to configure S3 buckets with the least privilege principle to prevent accidental
      public exposure of data.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to the public. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized access, potentially resulting in financial and reputational
      damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy: aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket
        <bucket-name> --policy <policy-json> ensuring the policy denies public access.
