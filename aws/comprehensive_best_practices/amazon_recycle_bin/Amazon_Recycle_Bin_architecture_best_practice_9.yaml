    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security by requiring an additional authentication
      factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts, as it requires an additional verification step. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if passwords are weak
      or compromised.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Review each user to ensure that
      MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage' and follow the instructions
      to assign an MFA device.
