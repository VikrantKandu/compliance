    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server Access Logging
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests
      that are made to an S3 bucket. Enabling this feature helps in security analysis
      and troubleshooting.
    Rationale: Enabling server access logging helps detect unauthorized access and
      provides valuable insights for security audits. Without logging, it is challenging
      to track access patterns and identify potential security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Check if 'Server access logging' is enabled under the 'Logging' section.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server access logging enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket for which you want to enable logging.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab and click 'Edit' in the 'Logging' section.
    - Enable server access logging and specify a target bucket for the logs.
    - Save the changes.
