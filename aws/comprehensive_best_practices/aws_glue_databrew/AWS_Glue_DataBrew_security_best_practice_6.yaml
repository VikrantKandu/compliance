    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default minimizes the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to the public. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data access, resulting in compliance violations and reputational
      damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the access control list for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not have public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access," ensure that all options are checked to block public
      access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
