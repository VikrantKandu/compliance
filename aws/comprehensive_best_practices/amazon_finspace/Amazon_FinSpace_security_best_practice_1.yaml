  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential
      information.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in accidental data
      leaks, unauthorized data access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to audit. 4. Check the bucket permissions and
      ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled. 5. Verify that
      there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Enable 'Block all public
      access' in the bucket settings. 5. Review and modify any bucket policies or
      ACLs that grant public access to ensure they are restricted.
