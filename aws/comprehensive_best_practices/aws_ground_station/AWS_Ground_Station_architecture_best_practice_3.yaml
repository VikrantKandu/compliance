  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to use server-side encryption
      to protect data at rest.
  - Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of unauthorized access to
      sensitive data. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets may be vulnerable
      to unauthorized access or breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties to verify that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings for each bucket.
  - Default Value: S3 buckets are not encrypted by default.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to encrypt.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
