    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      in the event of compromised passwords by requiring an additional authentication
      factor. Not enabling MFA increases the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - Select a user and go to the Security credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA device and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
