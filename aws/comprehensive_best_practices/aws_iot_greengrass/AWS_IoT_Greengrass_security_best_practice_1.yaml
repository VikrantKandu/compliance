    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers to
      access or manipulate data, potentially leading to data loss or reputational
      damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings and ensure all options are enabled
      to prevent public access.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not publicly accessible by default.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block public access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to the
      bucket.
