    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by requiring
      an additional verification method during sign-in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of identification beyond just a password. This
      helps protect against unauthorized access if a password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA enabled" status.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the Security credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA device and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
