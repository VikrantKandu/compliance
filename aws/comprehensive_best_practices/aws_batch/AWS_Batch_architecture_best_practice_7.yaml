    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive information
      is exposed.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and ensure no public
      access permissions are set.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to remove
      any public access permissions.
