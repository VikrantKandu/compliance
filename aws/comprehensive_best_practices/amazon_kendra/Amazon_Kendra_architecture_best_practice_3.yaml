    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Using default security
      groups can lead to unintended access and potential security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Default security groups allow unrestricted access, which can expose
      instances to unauthorized access and attacks. Custom security groups should
      be configured to allow only necessary traffic to and from instances.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that meet
      the security requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with the affected instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
