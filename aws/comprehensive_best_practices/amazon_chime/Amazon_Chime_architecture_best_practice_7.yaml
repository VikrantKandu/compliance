    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access allows anyone
      on the internet to view or modify the contents of the bucket, which could lead
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized individuals. By ensuring buckets
      are not public, organizations can protect their data from unintended exposure
      and potential misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that all public access is
      blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
