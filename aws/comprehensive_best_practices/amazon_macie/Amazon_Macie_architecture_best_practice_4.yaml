    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private protects against unauthorized
      access and data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access settings. 4. Confirm that no buckets
      have public read or write permissions. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL permissions. 6. Use the
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for public policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to modify. 4. Go to the Permissions tab. 5. Remove
      any public access settings from the bucket policy or ACL. 6. Enable bucket settings
      to block all public access. 7. Save changes to apply the new settings.
