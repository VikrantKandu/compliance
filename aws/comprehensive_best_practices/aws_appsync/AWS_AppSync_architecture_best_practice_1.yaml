    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS IAM users to enhance security. MFA provides an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to present multiple forms of identification before
      accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
      If MFA is not enabled, there is an increased risk of unauthorized access to
      AWS resources, which can lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by viewing the "Security credentials"
      tab.
    - Ensure that MFA is listed as "Assigned" for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select "Users".
    - Choose a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab and click on "Manage MFA".
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users.
