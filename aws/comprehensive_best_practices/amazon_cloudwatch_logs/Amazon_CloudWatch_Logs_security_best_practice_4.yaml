    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private
      Cloud (VPC) to enhance security and network management.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides additional security layers
      and network isolation. It allows for better control over inbound and outbound
      traffic and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left panel.
    - For each instance, check the VPC ID under the Description tab.
    - Ensure that the VPC ID is not empty and corresponds to a valid VPC.
    Default Value: By default, instances are launched in the default VPC if no specific
      VPC is selected.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any EC2 instances not within a VPC.
    - Create a new VPC if necessary.
    - Stop the instance and create an AMI.
    - Launch a new instance from the AMI within the desired VPC.
    - Terminate the original instance.
