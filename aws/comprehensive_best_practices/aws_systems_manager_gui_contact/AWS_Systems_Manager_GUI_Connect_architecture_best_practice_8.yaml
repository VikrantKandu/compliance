    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption ensures that the data
      stored in S3 is encrypted using AES-256 or AWS KMS, providing an additional
      layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
      Without encryption, data stored in S3 could be vulnerable to data breaches or
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Properties" tab.
    - Check the "Default encryption" section to confirm if server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Properties" tab.
    - Under the "Default encryption" section, choose "Enable" and select either "AES-256"
      or "AWS-KMS" for encryption.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
