    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket permissions and verify that public access
      is not granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Enable bucket policies that restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account
      level.
