    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data
      breaches and unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to sensitive
      information being accessed by unauthorized users, resulting in potential data
      loss and privacy violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as public.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the 'Permissions' tab, and
      verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click 'Edit' under 'Block public access'.
    - Ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled and save the changes.
