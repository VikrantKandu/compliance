    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access, posing significant security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy'
      to check bucket access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Disable 'Block public access' settings if they are enabled.
    - Review and update the bucket policies and access control lists to restrict public
      access.
