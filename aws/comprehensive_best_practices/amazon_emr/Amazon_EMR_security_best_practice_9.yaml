    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, stolen or compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      a second authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Verify that "Assigned MFA device" is set for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device to
      the user.
