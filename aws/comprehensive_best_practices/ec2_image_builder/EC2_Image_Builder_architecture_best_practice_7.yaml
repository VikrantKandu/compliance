    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an additional
      layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors
      to gain access to AWS resources, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances security by requiring
      additional verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA,
      if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker could gain access to AWS
      resources and potentially cause significant harm.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      --user-name <user-name> to programmatically check if MFA devices are associated
      with each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
