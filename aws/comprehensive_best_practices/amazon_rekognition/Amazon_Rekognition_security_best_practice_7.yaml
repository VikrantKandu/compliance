    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are private and not publicly
      accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized access to data, reducing
      the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access and that the Block
      Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and edit the bucket policy to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
    - Enable the Block Public Access settings if they are not already enabled.
