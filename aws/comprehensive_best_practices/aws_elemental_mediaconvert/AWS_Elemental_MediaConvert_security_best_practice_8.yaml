    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Have Termination Protection Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that termination protection is enabled for EC2
      instances to prevent accidental termination.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection on EC2 instances helps prevent accidental
      termination, which can lead to data loss and service disruption. This is especially
      important for critical instances that host important applications or data.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each running instance,
      check the 'Instance Settings'. 5. Verify that 'Termination Protection' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is disabled for EC2 instances.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. Select the instance for which
      you want to enable termination protection. 5. Click on 'Actions', then 'Instance
      Settings', and select 'Change Termination Protection'. 6. Enable termination
      protection and save changes.
