    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is critical to safeguarding
      data stored within AWS. Public access can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access, which can result in data loss or leakage.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public
      access permissions are granted.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" feature for all S3 buckets to prevent any public
      access.
    - Regularly audit bucket configurations to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
