    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      to the AWS Management Console by requiring users to enter both their password
      and a unique authentication code from their MFA device. This check ensures that
      MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if the password is compromised. Without MFA, there is a higher risk of
      account breaches, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column for the presence of an MFA device. 5. Verify that each user has an MFA
      device assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Choose 'Users' in the navigation pane. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In
      the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
      7. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
