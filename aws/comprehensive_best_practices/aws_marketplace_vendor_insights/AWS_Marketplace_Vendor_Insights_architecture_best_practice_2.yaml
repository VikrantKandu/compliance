    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also a
      unique code generated by an MFA device. This helps protect against unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources, as it requires a second form
      of verification. Not enabling MFA could lead to unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by selecting the user and viewing the
      Security Credentials tab.
    - Ensure that the MFA device is assigned to each IAM user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security Credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
