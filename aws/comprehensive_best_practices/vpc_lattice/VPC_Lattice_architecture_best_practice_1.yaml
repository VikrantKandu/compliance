    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts by requiring a second
      form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to the AWS account by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk
      of unauthorized access in case of compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and select 'Security credentials'.
    - Click 'Manage' in the 'Assigned MFA device' section and follow the prompts to
      enable MFA.
