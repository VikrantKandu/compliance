    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., an MFA device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials by requiring
      a second form of authentication, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised passwords can lead to unauthorized access to
      AWS resources, potentially resulting in data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user and check the
      'Security credentials' tab for MFA device status. 5. Verify that all users have
      an assigned MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. On the 'Security credentials' tab, choose 'Manage'
      under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign an
      MFA device to the user.
