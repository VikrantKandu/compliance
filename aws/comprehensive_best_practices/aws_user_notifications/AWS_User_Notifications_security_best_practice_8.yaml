    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches and compliance
      violations. By restricting public access, you reduce the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and meet compliance requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log into AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Remove any existing bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
