    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as they expose
      stored data to anyone on the internet. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential data
      leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access policies are applied.
    - Check for any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies to restrict access to specific users
      or roles.
