    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and is a critical security measure.
    Rationale: Server-side encryption provides an additional layer of security by
      automatically encrypting data at rest. Without encryption, data in S3 buckets
      could be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled. 4. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that encryption is configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the properties of the bucket and enable server-side
      encryption. 4. Choose the appropriate encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
      5. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
