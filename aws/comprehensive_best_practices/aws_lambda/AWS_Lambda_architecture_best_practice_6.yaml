    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access, resulting in potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private is critical for maintaining data security and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Step 5: Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify no
        public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Step 3: Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Step 4: Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access
        permissions.
