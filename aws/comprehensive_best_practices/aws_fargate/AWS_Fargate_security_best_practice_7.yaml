    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, an attacker only needs a password to gain access,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources and potential data
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to confirm that "MFA" is enabled under the "Security credentials"
      tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable MFA.
