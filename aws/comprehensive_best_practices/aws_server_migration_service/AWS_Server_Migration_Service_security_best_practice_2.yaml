    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to
      data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access minimizes the risk
      of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check if any bucket is publicly accessible by reviewing the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL).
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Under the Permissions tab, review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      public access.
    - Consider enabling Block Public Access settings for all buckets to prevent future
      public access configurations.
