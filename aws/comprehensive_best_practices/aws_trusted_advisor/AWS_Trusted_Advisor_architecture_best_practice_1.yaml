    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can inadvertently expose sensitive data. Unauthorized access to such data
      can lead to data breaches, reputational damage, and potential legal implications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the "Access" column for each bucket.
    - Ensure that none of the buckets are marked as "Public".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that the bucket's access control list does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy or access control list (ACL) to remove public access
      permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
