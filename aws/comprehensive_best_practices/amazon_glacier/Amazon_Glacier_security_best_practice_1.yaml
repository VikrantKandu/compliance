    Title: Ensure CloudWatch Logs are Encrypted at Rest
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon CloudWatch Logs are encrypted at rest
      using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Encrypting log data at rest protects
      sensitive information and meets compliance requirements for data protection.
    Rationale: Encrypting CloudWatch Logs at rest ensures that sensitive data is protected
      from unauthorized access. Failure to encrypt logs can lead to data breaches
      and non-compliance with regulatory standards.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
    - Step 3: Select Logs from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: For each log group, check if a KMS key is associated with the log group
        for encryption.
    - Step 5: Verify that the KMS key used is active and properly managed.
    Default Value: By default, CloudWatch Logs are not encrypted at rest.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
    - Step 3: Select Logs from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: Choose the log group that needs encryption.
    - Step 5: Edit the log group settings to associate it with a KMS key for encryption.
    - Step 6: Ensure the KMS key is active and has the necessary permissions for CloudWatch
        Logs.
