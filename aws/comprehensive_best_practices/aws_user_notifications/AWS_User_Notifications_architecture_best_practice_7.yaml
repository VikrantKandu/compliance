    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access, protecting
      against unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      sensitive data being accessible to anyone on the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have "Public access" enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      bucket policy and ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and edit the bucket policy to remove public access.
    - Disable any public access settings in the "Block public access" section.
    - Review and update the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public permissions.
