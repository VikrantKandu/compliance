    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of identification
      beyond just a password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or weak passwords. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains
      a user's password could gain full access to the account's resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA' column for each
      user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Click on the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage'
      in the 'Assigned MFA device' section. 6. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA
      device to the user.
