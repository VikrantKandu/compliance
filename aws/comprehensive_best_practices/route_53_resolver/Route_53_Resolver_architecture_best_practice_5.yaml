    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound and
      outbound traffic, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group, which allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, can expose instances to unauthorized access and potential attacks.
      Ensuring instances are associated with custom security groups with restricted
      access enhances security.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that none of the instances are using the
      default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group upon creation.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with the necessary rules. 3. Detach the default security
      group and attach the new security group to the instances.
