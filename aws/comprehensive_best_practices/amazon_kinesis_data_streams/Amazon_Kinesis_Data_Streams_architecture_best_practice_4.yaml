    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of accidental
      exposure of sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Verify that no buckets have public access settings enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME
      to check bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the "Block public access" settings to block all public access.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
