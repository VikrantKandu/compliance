    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles rather than directly
      to users to ensure consistent permissions management and to simplify policy
      updates.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures and increase the risk of granting excessive permissions. By using
      groups or roles, permissions are easier to manage and audit, reducing the potential
      for security vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: Select "Policies" from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: Review the list of policies and identify any that are attached directly
        to IAM users.
    - Step 5: Verify that all policies are attached only to groups or roles.
    Default Value: By default, AWS allows policies to be attached directly to users,
      groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify IAM policies attached directly to users.
    - Step 2: Detach these policies from users.
    - Step 3: Create or update IAM groups or roles with the necessary permissions.
    - Step 4: Attach the policies to the appropriate groups or roles.
    - Step 5: Add users to the groups or assign roles as needed.
