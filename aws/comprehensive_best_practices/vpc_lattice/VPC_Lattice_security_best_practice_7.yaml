    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      access and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps protect sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access settings
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy does not allow public access using aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
