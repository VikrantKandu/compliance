    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect sensitive data at rest. Enabling encryption helps safeguard
      data against unauthorized access and ensures compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access. Encrypted data provides an additional layer of security,
      protecting sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized users or
      services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties tab to verify if server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, server-side encryption is not enabled for S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the properties tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to ensure encryption is applied to the bucket.
