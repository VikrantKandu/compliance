    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an extra
      layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors
      to gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials,
      as it requires an additional verification factor beyond just a password. This
      mitigates the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources, which could lead
      to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure that the user completes the MFA setup process.
