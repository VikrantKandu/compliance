  - ID: AWS-001
  - Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all Regions
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to provide a
      record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service. CloudTrail logs
      are essential for security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance
      auditing.
  - Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that all AWS account activity
      is logged, enabling comprehensive monitoring and auditing. Without CloudTrail,
      unauthorized access and changes to your AWS environment may go undetected.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      console. 3. Ensure there is at least one trail configured per region. 4. Verify
      that the trail is logging to an S3 bucket and that log file validation is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, AWS CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the CloudTrail
      console. 3. Create a new trail or edit an existing trail to cover all regions.
      4. Ensure the trail is logging to an S3 bucket and enable log file validation.
