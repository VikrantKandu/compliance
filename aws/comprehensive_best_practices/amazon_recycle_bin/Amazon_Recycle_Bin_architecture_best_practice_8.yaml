    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of data breaches and unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to sensitive
      data being exposed to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict access.
    - Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Utilize AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access configurations.
