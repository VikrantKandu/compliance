    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not attached directly to
      individual users, but rather to groups or roles, to simplify management and
      enhance security.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can complicate policy management
      and increase the risk of excessive permissions. By attaching policies to groups
      or roles, you can manage permissions more effectively and reduce the risk of
      privilege escalation.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Click on "Policies" in the left navigation pane.
    - Step 4: For each policy, check the "Entities" tab to ensure policies are attached
        only to groups or roles, not individual users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify IAM policies attached directly to users.
    - Step 2: Create a group or role that reflects the necessary permissions.
    - Step 3: Attach the policy to the group or role instead.
    - Step 4: Add users to the group or assign them the role, removing direct policy
        attachments.
