  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      account compromise. If an attacker gains access to the root account, they have
      full control over all resources in the AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. Check the security status section for MFA on the root account. 4. Verify
      if MFA is enabled for the root account.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM Dashboard. 3. In the security status section, choose 'Activate MFA
      on your root account.' 4. Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the root account
      using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
