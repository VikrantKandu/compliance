    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to only authorized users minimizes this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, but configurations
      can change this setting.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and block all public access.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
