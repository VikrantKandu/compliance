    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining the
      confidentiality and integrity of the data stored within them. Public access
      can lead to data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent any future public
      access configuration.
