    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure no bucket has public-read or public-read-write permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public-read or public-read-write ACL permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access policies.
