    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and should be avoided
      unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      against data exposure and potential security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for any buckets marked as
      "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the Permissions tab, and verify
      that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      level.
    - Ensure that any required public access is justified and properly documented.
