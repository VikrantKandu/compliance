    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Setting S3 buckets to private reduces the risk of data breaches by
      preventing unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that each bucket's permissions do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
