    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance the security of user accounts. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such
      as a code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, even if a user's password is compromised. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks, password leaks, and other
      forms of credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Check the MFA column for each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list all MFA devices and verify association with users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the
      user.
