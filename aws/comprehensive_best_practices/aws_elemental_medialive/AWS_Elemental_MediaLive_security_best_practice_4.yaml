    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Public
      access to S3 buckets should be restricted unless explicitly required for specific
      use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      or confidential data is exposed to the internet. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential
      malicious activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for any public
      access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check for public access configurations.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If public access is not required, update the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Disable public access settings in the bucket permissions.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to all buckets
      in the account.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
