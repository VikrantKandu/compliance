    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      root account to add an extra layer of security. This helps prevent unauthorized
      access even if the root account password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to your AWS environment. The root account has unrestricted
      access to all resources, making it a prime target for attackers. Without MFA,
      a compromised password could lead to full control over the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA for the root account.
    - Ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select the root account settings.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA, using a virtual MFA device or hardware key.
