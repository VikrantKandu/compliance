    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an additional
      layer of protection on top of passwords, requiring users to provide a second
      form of identification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is exposed, an attacker can gain
      unauthorized access to AWS resources. MFA helps prevent unauthorized access
      even if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
