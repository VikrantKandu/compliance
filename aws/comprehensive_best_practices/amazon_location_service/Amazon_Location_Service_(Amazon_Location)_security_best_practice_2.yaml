  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be restricted unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data exposure and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      permissions are granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked unless configured
      otherwise.
  - Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to enforce restrictions.
