    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance the security of AWS
      accounts. MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring not only a password
      and username but also something that only the user has on them, such as a physical
      token or mobile device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials and reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials
      are compromised, an attacker could gain access to AWS resources. MFA significantly
      mitigates this risk by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
