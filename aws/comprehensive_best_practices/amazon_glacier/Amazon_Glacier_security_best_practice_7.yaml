    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and
      pose a security risk if not properly managed.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets can be configured to allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible reduces the risk of data breaches and complies with security best
      practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, review the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Verify that the block public access settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have block public access settings enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable the block all public access settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Ensure that any required access is granted through IAM roles or specific bucket
      policies.
