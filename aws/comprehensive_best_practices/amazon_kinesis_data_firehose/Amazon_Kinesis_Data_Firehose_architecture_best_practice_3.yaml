    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that the settings block all public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block Public Access".
    - Enable all options to block public access and save the changes.
