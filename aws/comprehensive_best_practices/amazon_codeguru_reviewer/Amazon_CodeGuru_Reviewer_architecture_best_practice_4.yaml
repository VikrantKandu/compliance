    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is critical to maintaining data
      privacy and security. Misconfigured buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      and data leaks, posing significant risks to the organization.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to verify that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any policies or ACLs
      that grant public access.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access setting for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
