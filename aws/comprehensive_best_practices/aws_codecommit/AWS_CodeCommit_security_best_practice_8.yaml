  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access and ensure that only authorized users have access
      to the data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access minimizes the risk of data exposure and helps maintain data privacy and
      security.
  - Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to review the bucket permissions.
      Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that they
      do not allow public access. Additionally, use the S3 Block Public Access feature
      to ensure that public access is blocked at the account and bucket levels.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not allowed
      unless explicitly configured.
  - Remediation: If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions. Enable the S3 Block Public
      Access feature for all accounts and buckets to prevent accidental exposure.
      Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
