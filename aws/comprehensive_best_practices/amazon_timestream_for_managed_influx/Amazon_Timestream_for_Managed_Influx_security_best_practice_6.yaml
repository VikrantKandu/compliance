    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      in case credentials are compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial as it significantly reduces the
      risk of account compromise. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are stolen,
      an attacker can gain full access to the AWS resources associated with that account,
      potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list MFA devices and verify their association with users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
