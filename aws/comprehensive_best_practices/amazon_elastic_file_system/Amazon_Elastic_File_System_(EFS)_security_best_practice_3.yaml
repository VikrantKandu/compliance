    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required for business purposes.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access settings.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
