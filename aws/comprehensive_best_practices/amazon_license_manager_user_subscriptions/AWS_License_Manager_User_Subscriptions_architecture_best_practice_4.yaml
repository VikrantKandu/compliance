    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra layer of protection on top of usernames
      and passwords. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible to unauthorized access,
      which can lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-mfa-devices' to list MFA
      devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user name to open their details.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
