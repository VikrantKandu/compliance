    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in potential data breaches, financial loss, and damage to the
      organization's reputation. Ensuring buckets are private by default mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access settings
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify that the bucket ACL
      does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket policy using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to ensure it does not permit public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove the public access permissions
      immediately.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users and roles.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
