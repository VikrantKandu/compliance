    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can expose EC2 instances to unauthorized
      access, as they allow unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic. This can lead
      to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Ensure that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if not explicitly specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the application's needs.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the instances from the default security group to ensure compliance.
