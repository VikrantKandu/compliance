    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and not publicly accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Public buckets can lead to data leaks and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy to remove public
      access.
    - Modify ACLs to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings.
