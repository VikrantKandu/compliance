    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks. Public access to S3 buckets can
      lead to exposure of sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Check the permissions tab for each S3 bucket to ensure that public access is
      blocked.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public read/write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to review and modify bucket policies
      and ACLs.
    - Apply bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings on all S3 buckets.
