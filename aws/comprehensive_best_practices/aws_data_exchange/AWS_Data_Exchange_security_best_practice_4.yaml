    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS
      IAM users. A strong password policy helps protect against unauthorized access
      by enforcing password complexity, expiration, and reuse conditions.
    Rationale: Implementing a strong IAM password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to weak passwords. Without a strong password policy, accounts are
      more vulnerable to brute force attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings."
    - Verify that the password policy is configured with the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Requires at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number,
        and one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Password expiration period is set.
      - Prevent password reuse.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy, leaving accounts
      vulnerable to weak passwords.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings."
    - Configure the password policy to enforce the desired complexity, expiration,
      and reuse conditions.
    - Save the changes to apply the password policy.
