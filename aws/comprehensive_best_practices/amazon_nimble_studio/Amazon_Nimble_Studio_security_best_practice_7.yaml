    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data security and privacy.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access, potentially resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure that
      public access is not allowed.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the S3 console and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure all public access settings are enabled to block public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
