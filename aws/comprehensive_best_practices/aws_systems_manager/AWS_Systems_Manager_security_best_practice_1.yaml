    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions
      enabled. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings and ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust ACL settings to restrict access to authorized users only.
