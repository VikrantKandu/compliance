    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are launched using the latest
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure they have the latest security patches
      and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to security vulnerabilities
      that have been addressed in later versions. Ensuring instances use the latest
      AMIs reduces the risk of exploitation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - For each running instance, check the AMI ID and compare it against the latest
      available AMI for that instance type.
    - Verify that the AMI ID matches the latest version.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with older AMIs if not explicitly updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create an instance from the latest AMI and migrate workloads to the new instance.
    - Terminate the instance using the outdated AMI after successful migration.
