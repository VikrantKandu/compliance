  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
      to protect data at rest. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets helps protect data from unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches. Without encryption, data is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, especially if access controls are misconfigured.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and go to the Properties tab. 4. Check if Default Encryption
      is enabled. Verify that the buckets are encrypted using AES-256 or AWS KMS.
  - Default Value: S3 buckets are not encrypted by default.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is not encrypted. 4. Go to the Properties tab and
      enable Default Encryption. 5. Choose server-side encryption with AES-256 or
      AWS KMS for encryption.
