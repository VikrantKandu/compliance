    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings in the S3 console.
    - Review and adjust any IAM policies that grant public access to the bucket.
