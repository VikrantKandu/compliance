    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance the security of AWS accounts by requiring an additional authentication
      factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users --query 'Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null]'
        to list users with passwords and check their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' and then 'Manage MFA device.'
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
