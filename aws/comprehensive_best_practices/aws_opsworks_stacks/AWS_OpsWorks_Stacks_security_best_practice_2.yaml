    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to the data stored within them. Ensuring
      privacy for S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data security and compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      data access. By ensuring that S3 buckets are private, you mitigate the risk
      of exposing sensitive data to the public internet, thereby enhancing the security
      posture of your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and ACLs and verify
      that public access is not granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Consider using AWS Config or AWS Security Hub to continuously monitor and alert
      on public S3 buckets.
