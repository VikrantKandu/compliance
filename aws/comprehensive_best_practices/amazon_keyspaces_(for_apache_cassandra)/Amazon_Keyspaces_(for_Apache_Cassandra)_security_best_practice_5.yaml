    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Ensuring buckets are not public by default reduces the risk of accidental data
      exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Save changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
