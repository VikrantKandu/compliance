    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two
      or more verification factors to gain access, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks, brute force attacks,
      and other forms of credential compromise.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
        ensure all users have MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the steps to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure all users have MFA enabled by repeating the process for each user.
