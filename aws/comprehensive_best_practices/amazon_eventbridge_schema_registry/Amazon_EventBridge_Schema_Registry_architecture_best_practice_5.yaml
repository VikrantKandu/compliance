    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of protection on top of a username and password, enhancing security by requiring
      a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      could gain access to AWS resources and data. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring
      a second form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the username for which you want to enable MFA.
    - In the Security credentials tab, click on Manage under the Multi-factor authentication
      section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
