    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets
      are private, but misconfigurations can lead to public exposure.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private reduces the risk of data breaches and
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive information,
      leading to potential data loss and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab to ensure that the bucket is
      not publicly accessible. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
      5. Review the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket's
      permissions to remove public access. 2. Update the bucket policy to restrict
      access to authorized users or roles only. 3. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private to set the bucket ACL to
      private. 4. Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure they
      remain compliant with best practices.
