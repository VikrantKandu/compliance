    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled by checking the "Block
      all public access" setting.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the bucket's permissions
      settings.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
