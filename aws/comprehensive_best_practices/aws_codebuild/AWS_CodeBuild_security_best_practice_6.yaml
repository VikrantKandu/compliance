    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. Enabling MFA provides
      an additional layer of security by requiring users to present two or more separate
      forms of identification when logging into the AWS Management Console or making
      programmatic requests.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect your AWS resources by requiring an additional
      verification step beyond just a password. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password
      is compromised, an attacker can gain full access to your AWS resources. MFA
      significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list all MFA devices and ensure each user has one assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Click on 'Users' and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
