  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining
      data privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers
      to access, modify, or delete data, leading to data loss or unauthorized data
      disclosure.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings. 4. Ensure that
      "Block all public access" is enabled. 5. Review bucket policies and ACLs to
      ensure they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have "Block all public access" enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console and select the bucket. 2. Click on "Permissions"
      and then "Block public access". 3. Enable "Block all public access" and save
      changes. 4. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public
      access permissions.
