    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console and select the bucket.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Under 'Block public access (bucket settings)', click 'Edit'.
    - Ensure all options are checked to block public access.
    - Save changes to apply the settings.
