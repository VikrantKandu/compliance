    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled, which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security
      risk.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public buckets can
      lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings, and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to adjust permissions, or use the CLI commands
      to update policies.
    - Consider enabling the Block Public Access feature for additional security.
