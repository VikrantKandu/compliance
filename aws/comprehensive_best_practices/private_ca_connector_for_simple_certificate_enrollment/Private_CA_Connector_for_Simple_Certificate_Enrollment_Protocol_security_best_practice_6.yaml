    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Restricting public access helps to secure data and maintain privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access permissions set.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket's Access Control List (ACL).
    - Check for the presence of any public access configurations in the bucket policy
      using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block Public Access settings.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL if necessary.
