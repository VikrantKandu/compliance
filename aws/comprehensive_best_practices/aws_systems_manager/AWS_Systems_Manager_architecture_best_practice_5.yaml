    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Public
      access can be controlled by bucket policies, ACLs, and the S3 Block Public Access
      feature.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible protects sensitive information and maintains data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket policy or ACL grants
      public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to review and update bucket policies and
      ACLs.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and update them as needed to ensure they
      do not allow public access.
