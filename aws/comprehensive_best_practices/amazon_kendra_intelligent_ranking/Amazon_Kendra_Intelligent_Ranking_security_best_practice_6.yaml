    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users in your
      AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security on top of the username and
      password, making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access your
      AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by requiring a second
      form of verification, reducing the risk of compromised credentials leading to
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, the risk of account compromise is higher,
      potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by viewing the "MFA" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
      check for users without MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
