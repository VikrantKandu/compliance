  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, which enhances account security.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
      If an IAM user's password is exposed, MFA provides an additional barrier that
      prevents unauthorized access to AWS resources.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify that MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In
      the "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
      7. Follow the on-screen instructions to activate the MFA device for the user.
