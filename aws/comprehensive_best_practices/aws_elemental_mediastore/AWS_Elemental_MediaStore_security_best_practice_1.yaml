  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a security risk as they can be
      accessed by anyone on the internet, leading to potential data breaches and loss
      of sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions to ensure that
      there are no public access settings enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically verify the bucket's
      ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check for bucket policies that allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured to be so.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL. 2.
      Update the bucket policy to deny public access. 3. Use the S3 Block Public Access
      feature to prevent new public access settings from being applied.
