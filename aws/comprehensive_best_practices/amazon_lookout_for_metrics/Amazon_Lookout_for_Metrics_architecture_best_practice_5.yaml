    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private helps prevent unauthorized access and data
      breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks, financial loss,
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to verify they do not
      grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Update the ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent any public access
      configurations.
