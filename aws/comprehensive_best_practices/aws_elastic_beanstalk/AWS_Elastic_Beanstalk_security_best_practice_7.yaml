    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Have Proper Security Group Configurations
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are associated with security
      groups that have appropriate inbound and outbound rules. Security groups act
      as virtual firewalls for your instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
      Proper configuration helps to protect instances from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Properly configured security groups are essential to protect EC2 instances
      from unauthorized access and potential attacks. Misconfigured security groups
      could expose instances to threats such as unauthorized data access, data breaches,
      and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select the 'Instances' option in the navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that the inbound and outbound rules align with the principle of least
      privilege, allowing only necessary traffic.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-security-groups to review
      security group configurations.
    Default Value: By default, security groups allow all outbound traffic and no inbound
      traffic, which may not align with specific security requirements.
    Remediation:
    - Review the security group rules for each instance.
    - Modify the inbound rules to allow only necessary traffic from specific IP ranges
      or security groups.
    - Ensure outbound rules only allow required traffic.
    - Regularly review and update security group rules to align with security policies
      and requirements.
