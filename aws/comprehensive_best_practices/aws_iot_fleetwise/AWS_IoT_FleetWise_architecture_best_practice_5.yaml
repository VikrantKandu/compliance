    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to AWS accounts by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      in the event that a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources by adding an additional layer of security. Without MFA, if
      a user's password is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain full access
      to the user's permissions and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
