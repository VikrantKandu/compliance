  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, usually
      a temporary code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access, especially if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, attackers could
      gain full control over AWS resources, leading to data breaches, financial loss,
      and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Click on each user to view their
      details. 5. Check if 'Assigned MFA device' is configured for each user. 6. Ensure
      that all users have an MFA device assigned.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Under 'Security credentials', select 'Manage
      MFA device'. 6. Follow the wizard to assign a virtual MFA device to the user.
