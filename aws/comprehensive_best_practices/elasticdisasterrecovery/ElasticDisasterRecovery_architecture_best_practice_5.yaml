  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can lead to data breaches, which could have legal
      and financial repercussions.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Confirm that the bucket ACLs (Access Control Lists) do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the policy status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies that grant public access.
    - Update the bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
