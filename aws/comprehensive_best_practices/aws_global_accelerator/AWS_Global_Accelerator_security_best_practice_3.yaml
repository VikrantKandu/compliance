    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access minimizes the risk
      of data exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
