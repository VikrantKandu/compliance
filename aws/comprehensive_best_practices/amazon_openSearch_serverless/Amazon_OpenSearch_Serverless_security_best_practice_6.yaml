    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk by
      potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps comply with data protection regulations and minimizes the
      risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure no bucket has public access enabled through bucket policies or Access
      Control Lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires remediation.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
