    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality,
      reducing the risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block Public Access'.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
