    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring these buckets are private mitigates the risk of data exposure
      and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy allowing public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
