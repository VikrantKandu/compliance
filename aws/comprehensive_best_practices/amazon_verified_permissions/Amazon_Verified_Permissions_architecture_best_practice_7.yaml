    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access, which enhances the security
      of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS
      account, and if compromised, it can lead to potential data breaches and unauthorized
      changes to cloud resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Locate the root account and check if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam get-account-summary' to verify
      the status of MFA on the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Click on the root account and select 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device.
