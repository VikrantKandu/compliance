    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security by requiring a second form
      of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users provides an additional layer of security,
      reducing the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to see if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the user requiring MFA from the 'Users' list.
    - Click on the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure the user configures their MFA device following AWS guidelines.
