    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the
      protection of AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts, as it requires both a password and a second factor (such as
      a physical device or app) to log in. Without MFA, compromised credentials could
      lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify whether MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam get-user to check the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", choose "Manage" and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
