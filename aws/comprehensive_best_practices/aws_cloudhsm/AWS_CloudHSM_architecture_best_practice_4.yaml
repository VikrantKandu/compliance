    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in the AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of identification beyond their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial as it significantly reduces the
      risk of unauthorized account access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could
      lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all MFA devices and verify that each user has an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
