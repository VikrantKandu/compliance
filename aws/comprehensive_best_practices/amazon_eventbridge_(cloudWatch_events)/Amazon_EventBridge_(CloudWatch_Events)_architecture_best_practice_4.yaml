    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' on each S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
