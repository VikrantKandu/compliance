    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance
      the security of AWS account access. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on
      top of username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect sensitive resources and data
      from unauthorized access. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's
      credentials can easily compromise the account, leading to potential data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the left pane.
    - Select the IAM user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate the MFA device.
