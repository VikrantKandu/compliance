    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you reduce the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, leading
      to potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket
        ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the
        bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
