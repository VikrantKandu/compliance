  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket. 4. Ensure that
      the bucket policies do not allow public read or write access. 5. Verify that
      the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Update the bucket policy
      to remove any public access permissions. 5. Enable the "Block Public Access"
      settings for the bucket to prevent future public access.
