    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and potential misuse of data, which can have severe legal and financial consequences
      for an organization.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies that grant public access.
    - Adjust bucket ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent public access
      settings from being applied.
