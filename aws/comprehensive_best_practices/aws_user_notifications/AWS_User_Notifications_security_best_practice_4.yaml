    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to data
      breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches. Restricting public access helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Ensure no public access is granted in the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove public access permissions if necessary.
