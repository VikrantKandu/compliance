    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two
      or more verification factors to gain access, significantly enhancing account
      security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      by requiring additional verification beyond just a username and password. This
      reduces the risk of compromised credentials leading to unauthorized access to
      AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the MFA column
      to verify that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws
      iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      authentication section, choose Assign MFA device. 7. Follow the instructions
      to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
