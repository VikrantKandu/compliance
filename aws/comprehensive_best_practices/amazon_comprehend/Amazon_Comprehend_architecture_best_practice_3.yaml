  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation of instance types
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest generation
      of instance types. Using the latest generation can provide better performance,
      enhanced features, and improved cost efficiency.
  - Rationale: Using outdated instance types can lead to suboptimal performance and
      higher costs. The latest generation of instances often includes improvements
      in processing power, memory, and network capabilities, as well as enhanced security
      features.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. List all running instances. 4. Check the instance type for each instance.
      5. Compare the instance type against the latest generation instance types available
      in the AWS region. 6. Identify any instances not using the latest generation.
  - Default Value: Instances may be of any generation, including older generations.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances not using the latest generation. 2. Plan for
      downtime or a maintenance window if necessary. 3. Stop the instance. 4. Change
      the instance type to the latest generation. 5. Start the instance. 6. Verify
      that the instance is running as expected with the new type.
