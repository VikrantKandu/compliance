    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive
      information and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket ACL with aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> --acl private.
    - Use the AWS CLI to delete any public bucket policies with aws s3api delete-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
