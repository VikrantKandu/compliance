    Title: Ensure CloudFormation stacks have termination protection enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks have termination
      protection enabled to prevent accidental deletion of resources.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection prevents accidental deletion of CloudFormation
      stacks, which could lead to loss of critical resources and data. This is particularly
      important for production environments where accidental deletions can cause significant
      downtime and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Step 3: Select each stack and check if termination protection is enabled.
    - Step 4: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation describe-stacks
        and check the EnableTerminationProtection attribute for each stack.
    Default Value: Termination protection is disabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Step 3: Select the stack for which you want to enable termination protection.
    - Step 4: Click on "Stack Actions" and select "Enable Termination Protection".
    - Step 5: Confirm the action to enable termination protection for the stack.
