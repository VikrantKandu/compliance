    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure continued compliance.
