  - ID: AWS-S3-Encryption-01
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption enabled
      to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and data breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3
      is at risk of being accessed by unauthorized users, which can lead to data loss
      or legal consequences.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to check. 4. Go to the "Properties" tab. 5. Check
      the "Default encryption" section to ensure that server-side encryption is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have default encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to configure. 4. Go to the "Properties" tab. 5.
      In the "Default encryption" section, enable server-side encryption by selecting
      either "AWS-KMS" or "S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)". 6. Save the changes to apply
      encryption.
