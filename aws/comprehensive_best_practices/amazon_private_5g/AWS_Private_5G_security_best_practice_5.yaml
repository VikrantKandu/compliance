    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the permissions settings. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Verify that the "Block Public Access"
      settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly
      accessible. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Edit the bucket policy to
      remove any statements allowing public access. 5. Enable "Block Public Access"
      settings for the bucket.
