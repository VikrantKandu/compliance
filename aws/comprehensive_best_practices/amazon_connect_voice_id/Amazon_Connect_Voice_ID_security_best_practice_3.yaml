    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires an additional authentication
      factor beyond just a password, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is a critical security measure. The
      root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account, making
      it a prime target for attackers. Without MFA, the account is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, which could lead to data breaches or misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the Users section and locate the root account.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam get-account-summary and check
        the 'AccountMFAEnabled' field.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account and choose 'Enable MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to configure a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure the MFA device is successfully configured and tested.
