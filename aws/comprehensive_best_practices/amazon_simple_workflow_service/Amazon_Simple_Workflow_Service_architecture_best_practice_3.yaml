    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      posing a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible,
      organizations can prevent unauthorized data exposure and maintain data privacy
      and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public access" enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket that is publicly accessible, navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Disable public access settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
