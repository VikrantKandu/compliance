  - ID: AWS-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized public access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible may expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions settings for each bucket. 4. Ensure that bucket policies
      and ACLs do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Review and edit the bucket policy
      and ACLs to remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable bucket settings
      to block all public access if applicable.
