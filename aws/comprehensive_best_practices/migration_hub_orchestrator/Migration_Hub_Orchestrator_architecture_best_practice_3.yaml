    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured
      with appropriate access permissions.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data leaks and
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access must be explicitly
      granted.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Remove any 'Allow' statements in the bucket policy that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or Management Console to apply changes and verify that the bucket
      is no longer publicly accessible.
