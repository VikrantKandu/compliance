  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access
        settings enabled.
    - Step 4: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>'
        to verify the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
        to review the bucket policy for any public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not have public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket to modify.
    - Step 3: Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Disable any public access settings and remove any public bucket policies.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public
        access.
