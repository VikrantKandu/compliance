    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Public access can lead to
      data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets. 4. For each bucket, check the "Access" column
      for any indication of public access. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check the bucket's ACL for
      public access permissions. 6. Ensure that no bucket allows public access unless
      explicitly required and approved.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and do not allow
      public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon
      S3 service. 3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Edit the "Block public access" settings and enable all options to block
      public access. 6. Review and remove any public access permissions from the bucket
      policy and ACLs. 7. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly
      accessible.
