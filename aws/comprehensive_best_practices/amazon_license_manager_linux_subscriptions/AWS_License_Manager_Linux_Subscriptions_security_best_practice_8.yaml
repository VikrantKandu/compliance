    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. It is crucial
      to restrict access to only authorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs grant
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to inspect
      the bucket ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
