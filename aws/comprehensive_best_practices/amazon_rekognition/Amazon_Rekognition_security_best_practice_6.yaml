    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private minimizes the risk of unauthorized data
      access and potential data breaches. Public S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone
      on the internet, which poses a significant security risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and ensure that there are no public access
      settings enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and only the bucket owner has
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI to update bucket ACLs and policies to restrict access.
