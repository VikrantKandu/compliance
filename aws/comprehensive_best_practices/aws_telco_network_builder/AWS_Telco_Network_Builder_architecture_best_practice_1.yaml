    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      account compromise by requiring a second factor of authentication in addition
      to the password. Without MFA, unauthorized access to the root account can lead
      to severe security breaches and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Dashboard" option.
    - Check the "Security Status" section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the "AccountMFAEnabled" value.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Activate MFA on your root account" in the "Security Status" section.
    - Follow the prompts to set up and activate MFA using a virtual MFA device or
      hardware MFA device.
