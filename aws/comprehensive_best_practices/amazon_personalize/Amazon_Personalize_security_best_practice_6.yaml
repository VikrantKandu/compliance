  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing or modifying data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block
      all public access" setting is enabled. 4. Review bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked unless
      explicitly configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket. 2.
      Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
