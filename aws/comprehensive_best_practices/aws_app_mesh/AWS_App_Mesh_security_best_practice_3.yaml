    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS
      IAM users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy helps prevent unauthorized access
      by requiring users to create complex passwords that are difficult to guess or
      crack. Without a strong password policy, accounts are more vulnerable to brute
      force attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Account settings.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets the organization's security
      requirements.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Account settings.
    - Enable and configure the password policy to meet organizational security requirements,
      such as minimum password length, requiring numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase
      letters, and password expiration.
