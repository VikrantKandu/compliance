    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      and data leakage. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of exposing
      sensitive information to the public.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions (e.g., 'Everyone' or 'Any
      authenticated AWS user') granted.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions by editing the bucket policy or access
      control list (ACL).
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings for the bucket.
