    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that all public access is
      blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - For each bucket, enable the "Block all public access" setting in the S3 console.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
