    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential
      information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      data access, data leaks, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring S3 buckets
      are not public helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      check ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to review bucket policies and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access settings'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
