    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide more than one piece of evidence to authenticate.
      This best practice ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to protect against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's credentials
      are exposed, an attacker could gain full access to the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
      verify that all users have an associated MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on each user for whom MFA is not enabled.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
