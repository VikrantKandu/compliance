    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users in your AWS account. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the
      protection of your AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended to reduce the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS environment. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead
      to unauthorized actions, data breaches, or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Set up MFA by clicking 'Manage' and following the on-screen instructions to
      enable MFA.
