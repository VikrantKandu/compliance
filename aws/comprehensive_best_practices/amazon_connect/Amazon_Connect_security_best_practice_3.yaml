    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users. Enabling
      MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form
      of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect sensitive AWS resources from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an
      attacker can gain access to AWS resources without any additional verification.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Step 4: Click on the user name to open the user details.
    - Step 5: Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Step 6: Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
