    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) password policies
      are enabled to enforce strong password requirements for user accounts. This
      includes setting minimum password length, requiring at least one uppercase letter,
      one lowercase letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric character, and enabling
      password expiration.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy helps protect user accounts from
      unauthorized access and reduces the risk of data breaches. Weak passwords can
      easily be compromised, leading to potential security incidents and unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and that it meets the recommended
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'.
    - Click on 'Change password policy'.
    - Enable the password policy and configure it to require a minimum password length
      of at least 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter,
      one number, and one non-alphanumeric character.
    - Set the password expiration to a suitable period, such as 90 days.
    - Save the changes.
