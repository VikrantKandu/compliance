    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to unauthorized access and data leakage. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and comply with security
      standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that there are no public access
      settings enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and edit the Block public access settings.
    - Ensure that all public access is blocked.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
