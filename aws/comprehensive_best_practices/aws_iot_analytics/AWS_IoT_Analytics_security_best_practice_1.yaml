    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access settings
      should be reviewed and restricted to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive data from being
      accessed by unauthorized users, reducing the risk of data leaks and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure that all options under 'Block public access' are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable all options under 'Block public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
