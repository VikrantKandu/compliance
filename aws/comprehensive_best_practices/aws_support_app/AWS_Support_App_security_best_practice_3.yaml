    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in unintended data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Restricting access to only necessary entities reduces
      the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Review the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Enable "Block public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to manage access
      permissions effectively.
