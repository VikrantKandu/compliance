    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security. MFA adds an extra
      layer of protection on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources
      by requiring an additional factor of authentication. Without MFA, accounts are
      more vulnerable to compromise through password theft or phishing attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
