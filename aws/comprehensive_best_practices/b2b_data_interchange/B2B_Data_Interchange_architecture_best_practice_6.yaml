    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets in your AWS account are not
      publicly accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data exposure. Restricting public access reduces the risk of data breaches and
      ensures that only authorized users can access the data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Consider enabling the "Block Public Access" feature for the bucket.
