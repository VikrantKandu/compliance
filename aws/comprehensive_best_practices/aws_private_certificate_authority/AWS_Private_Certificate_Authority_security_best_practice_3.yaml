    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to EC2 instances. This can lead to unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, examine the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Assign the new security group to the EC2 instances that are currently using
      the default security group.
    - Remove the default security group from the EC2 instances.
