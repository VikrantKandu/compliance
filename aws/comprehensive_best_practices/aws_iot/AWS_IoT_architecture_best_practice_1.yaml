    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private protects against
      data leaks and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Confirm there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if not already enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
