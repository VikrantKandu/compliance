    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access to ensure sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as sensitive
      data may be exposed to anyone on the internet. By ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible, you minimize the risk of unauthorized data access and potential
      data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
