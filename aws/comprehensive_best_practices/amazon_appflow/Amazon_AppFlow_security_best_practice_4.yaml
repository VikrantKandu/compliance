    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) password policy
      is enabled to enforce strong password requirements for IAM users. This includes
      settings for password length, complexity, and expiration to reduce the risk
      of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy helps protect AWS accounts from
      unauthorized access. Weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked, leading
      to potential security breaches and unauthorized access to resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Verify that the password policy is configured with appropriate settings such
      as minimum password length, requiring at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase
      letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric character, and password expiration.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users can create passwords without any restrictions
      unless a password policy is explicitly set.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Set a password policy by specifying the minimum password length, requiring at
      least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric
      character, and setting password expiration and reuse prevention. Save the changes.
