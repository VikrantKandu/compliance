    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves setting the bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private minimizes the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the ACL settings to ensure no public read or write permissions are granted.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to programmatically verify ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Modify the ACL settings to ensure that only authorized users have access.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account
      level.
