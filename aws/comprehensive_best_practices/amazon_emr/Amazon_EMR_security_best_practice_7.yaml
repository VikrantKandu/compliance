    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private and
      use server-side encryption. This prevents unauthorized access and protects data
      at rest.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are public pose a significant security risk as they
      can expose sensitive data to the internet. Encryption helps protect data from
      unauthorized access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all buckets and verify their permissions to ensure they are not publicly
      accessible.
    - Check that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket by reviewing the
      bucket properties.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private but not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy or access control list
      (ACL) to ensure it is not publicly accessible.
    - Enable server-side encryption by configuring the bucket properties to use AES-256
      or AWS-KMS encryption.
