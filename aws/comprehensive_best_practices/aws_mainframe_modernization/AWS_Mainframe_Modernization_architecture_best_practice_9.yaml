    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional verification
      step during login.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to AWS accounts by requiring
      a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if
      credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check each IAM user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage" under "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
