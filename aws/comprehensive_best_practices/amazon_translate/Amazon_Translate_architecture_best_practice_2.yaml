  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is crucial to protect data
      stored in S3 by ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      intended.
  - Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private by default reduces the risk of data
      breaches and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to sensitive
      data exposure, data leaks, and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column to ensure they are
      marked as "Private." 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to programmatically verify the bucket ACL settings. 5. Ensure
      the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the bucket policy
      settings.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the bucket's permissions
      settings in the AWS Management Console. 2. Remove any public access settings
      or policies that grant public access. 3. Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket
      ACL to private using aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private.
      4. Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure compliance with the
      best practice.
