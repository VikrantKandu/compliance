    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket's access settings do not allow public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
