    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to benefit from the latest security patches
      and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer versions. Regularly updating AMIs helps maintain security
      and compliance with best practices.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the AMI ID used at launch.
    - Step 5: Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the instance's
        operating system and version.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with any available AMI, including outdated
      ones.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Step 2: Create a new AMI from the latest version available.
    - Step 3: Plan for a maintenance window to update instances.
    - Step 4: Launch new instances using the updated AMI.
    - Step 5: Terminate old instances after verifying the new ones are functioning
        correctly.
