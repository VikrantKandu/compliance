    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      check ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to check the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' feature in the S3 console to prevent future public
      access settings.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
