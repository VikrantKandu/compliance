    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for IAM
      users to enhance account security. The policy should enforce complexity requirements,
      expiration periods, and prevent password reuse.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access due to weak or compromised passwords. Without these controls, accounts
      are more vulnerable to brute force attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Verify that the password policy is configured with complexity requirements,
      expiration periods, and reuse prevention.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy on IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Select "Set password policy" and configure the policy to include complexity
      requirements, expiration periods, and password reuse prevention.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
