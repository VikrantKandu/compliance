  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for the AWS root account to provide an
      additional layer of security. MFA requires the user to present two or more separate
      forms of authentication, which significantly reduces the risk of account compromise.
  - Rationale: The AWS root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the
      AWS account. If compromised, it could result in unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches. Enabling MFA adds a critical security layer that helps protect
      the account from unauthorized access.

      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the 'root' account.
      5. Check the 'MFA' column for the root account to verify if MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the 'root'
