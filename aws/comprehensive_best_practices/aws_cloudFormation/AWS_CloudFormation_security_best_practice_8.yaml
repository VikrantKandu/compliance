    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public access can lead to data leaks, compliance violations,
      and potential exploitation by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the "Block all public
      access" setting.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access," ensure all options are checked.
    - Save changes to apply the settings.
