    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be enabled for all IAM users
      to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two
      or more verification factors to gain access, which significantly reduces the
      risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect accounts from unauthorized
      access. If an IAM user's credentials are compromised, MFA provides an additional
      security barrier. Not enabling MFA increases the risk of unauthorized access,
      which can lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that 'Assigned MFA device' is configured for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under the 'Assigned MFA device' section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
