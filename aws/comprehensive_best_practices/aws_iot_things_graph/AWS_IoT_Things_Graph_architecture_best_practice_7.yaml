    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not public reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure that all public access is
      blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure no bucket policy allows public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access needs to
      be explicitly granted.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Remove any bucket policy that grants public access.
    - Adjust bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
