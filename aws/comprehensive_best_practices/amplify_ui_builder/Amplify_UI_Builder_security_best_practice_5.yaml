  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure, financial
      loss, and damage to reputation.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
      4. Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Ensure that
      the block public access settings are enabled at both the account and bucket
      levels.
  - Default Value: By default, block public access settings are enabled for new S3
      buckets.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Click on the Permissions tab. 4. Review and modify
      the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any statements allowing public access.
      5. Enable block public access settings for the bucket and at the account level
      if not already enabled.
