    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: It is recommended to restrict public access to S3 buckets to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks,
      financial losses, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
