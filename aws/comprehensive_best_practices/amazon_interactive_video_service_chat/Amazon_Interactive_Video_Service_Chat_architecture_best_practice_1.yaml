    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      ensures data security and compliance with best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public
      access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Remove any policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to script the removal of public access if managing multiple
      buckets.
