    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, and
      operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. It provides event history
      of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management
      Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that all AWS account activity
      is logged, which is crucial for security and compliance purposes. Without it,
      unauthorized or malicious actions may go undetected.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Check if CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.
    - Verify that there is at least one trail configured to log all management events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to enable logging in all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is set to log all management events.
