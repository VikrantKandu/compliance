    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Data breaches can result in financial loss, legal penalties,
      and damage to reputation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Permissions' tab for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable all 'Block public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements allowing
      public access.
