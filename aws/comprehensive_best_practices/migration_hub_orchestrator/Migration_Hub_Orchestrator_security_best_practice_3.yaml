    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance violations, and
      security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting
      is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify the settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access unless intentionally
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' option in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to grant access only to specific users or roles as needed.
