    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access should be restricted to
      protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - In the 'Permissions' tab, enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
