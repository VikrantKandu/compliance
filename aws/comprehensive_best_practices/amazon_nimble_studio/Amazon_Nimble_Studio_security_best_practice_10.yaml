    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial as it provides an additional
      layer of security, protecting the account from unauthorized access even if the
      password is compromised. Without MFA, the root account is vulnerable to attacks,
      which could lead to data breaches or unauthorized modifications to resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA on the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled and configured correctly.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Manage MFA'.
    - Choose the type of MFA device to use and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
    - Ensure that MFA is activated and tested for the root account.
