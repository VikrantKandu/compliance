  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps prevent unauthorized access in case
      of compromised credentials.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      protecting sensitive data and resources. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks if passwords are compromised through phishing, brute force attacks,
      or other methods.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically
      check MFA status for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Click on the username
      of the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. In the 'Security credentials'
      tab, select 'Manage MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device
      or hardware MFA device to the user. 7. Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled
      to enhance security.
