    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps to safeguard sensitive
      data and meet compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect it from unauthorized access,
      especially in the event of a data breach. Without encryption, sensitive data
      stored in S3 could be exposed, leading to potential data loss or compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if the "Default encryption" is enabled under the "Default encryption"
      section.
    - Repeat the steps for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the Properties tab and click on "Edit" under the "Default encryption"
      section.
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes and repeat for other buckets as necessary.
