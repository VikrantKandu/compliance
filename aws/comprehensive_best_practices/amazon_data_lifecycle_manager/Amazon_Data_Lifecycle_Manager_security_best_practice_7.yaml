    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to verify that 'Block all public
      access' settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to confirm
      that the bucket's ACL does not allow public access.
    - Ensure bucket policies do not grant public access by reviewing the policy JSON.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
