    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their
      password.
    Rationale: MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised. Without
      MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's password could gain full access to the
      AWS account, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically check for
      MFA devices associated with each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Click on the user for whom you
      want to enable MFA. 5. Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA'.
      6. Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
