    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by the organization's security and compliance policies.
      Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are built on a secure and compliant
      baseline.
    Rationale: Approved AMIs are vetted for vulnerabilities and compliance requirements.
      Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security risks such as outdated software,
      misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities. Ensuring all instances use
      approved AMIs helps maintain a secure environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running instances and note their AMI IDs.
    - Compare the AMI IDs against the list of approved AMI IDs maintained by the organization.
    - Verify that all running instances use AMIs from the approved list.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Plan and execute a migration to instances launched with approved AMIs.
    - Update policies and automation scripts to restrict future instance launches
      to approved AMIs only.
