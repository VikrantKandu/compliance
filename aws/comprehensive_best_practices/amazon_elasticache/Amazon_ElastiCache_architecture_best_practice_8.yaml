    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure, making it crucial
      to restrict public access to prevent unauthorized data access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review each bucket's permissions under the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that
      the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket. 5. Verify
      that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable the "Block all public access" setting for any bucket that
      is publicly accessible. 2. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public
      access. 3. Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with best
      practices.
