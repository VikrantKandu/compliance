    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect
      your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA significantly reduces this risk
      by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the "MFA" column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the individual user.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage MFA device" and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
