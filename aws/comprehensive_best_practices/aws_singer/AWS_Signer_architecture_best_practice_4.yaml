    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can expose your instances to potential security threats.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can result in unintentional exposure
      of EC2 instances to the internet or other networks, leading to potential unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that the security group is not the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your application needs.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the EC2 instance.
    - Associate the custom security group with the EC2 instance.
