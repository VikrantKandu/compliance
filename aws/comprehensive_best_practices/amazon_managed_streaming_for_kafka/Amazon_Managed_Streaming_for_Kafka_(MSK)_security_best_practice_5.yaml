    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to confirm
      that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure that public access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not enabled
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and access control list.
    - Remove any statements granting public access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at
      the account level.
