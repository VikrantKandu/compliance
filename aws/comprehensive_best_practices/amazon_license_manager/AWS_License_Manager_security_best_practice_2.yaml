    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access to S3 buckets helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" on the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
