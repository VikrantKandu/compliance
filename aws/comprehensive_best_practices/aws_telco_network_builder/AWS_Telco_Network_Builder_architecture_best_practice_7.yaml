    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead
      to unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      is critical for maintaining data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
