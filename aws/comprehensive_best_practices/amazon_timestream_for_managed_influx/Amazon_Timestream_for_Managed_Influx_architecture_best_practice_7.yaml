    Title: Enable Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for your EC2 instances
      to provide more granular metrics, which can help in better analysis and troubleshooting.
    Rationale: Enabling detailed monitoring for EC2 instances provides additional
      metrics that are collected at a one-minute frequency. This can be crucial for
      understanding the performance and health of your applications. Without detailed
      monitoring, you might miss critical performance issues or trends.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select an EC2 instance.
    - In the Monitoring tab, check if Detailed Monitoring is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the Monitoring attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: Basic monitoring is enabled by default, which collects metrics
      at a five-minute frequency.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the EC2 instance that does not have detailed monitoring enabled.
    - Click on the 'Actions' button, then 'Monitor and troubleshoot', and select 'Manage
      detailed monitoring'.
    - Enable detailed monitoring and save the changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids
      <instance_id> to enable detailed monitoring.
