    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that a strong password policy is configured for IAM users
      to enhance security. A strong password policy should enforce password complexity
      and rotation.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources by ensuring that passwords are complex and changed regularly.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account Settings' from the left navigation pane.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets the organization's requirements
      for complexity and rotation.
    Default Value: By default, IAM password policy is not enforced.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account Settings' from the left navigation pane.
    - Enable the password policy and configure it to require at least one uppercase
      letter, one lowercase letter, one number, one non-alphanumeric character, and
      a minimum length of 8 characters.
    - Set the password expiration to 90 days and require password history to prevent
      reuse.
