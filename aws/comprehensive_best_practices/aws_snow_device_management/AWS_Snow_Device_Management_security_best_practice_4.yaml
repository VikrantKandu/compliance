    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches
      if sensitive data is exposed.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that public access
        settings are disabled.
    - Step 4: Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not grant
        public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Step 3: Go to the permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Step 4: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access
        as necessary.
