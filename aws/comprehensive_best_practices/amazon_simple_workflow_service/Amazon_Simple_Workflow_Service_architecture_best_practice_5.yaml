    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private helps
      maintain data confidentiality and compliance with various security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access permissions set.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove public
      access.
    - Enable bucket policies that explicitly deny public access, or use the block
      public access feature to prevent future changes that could make the bucket public.
