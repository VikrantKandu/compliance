    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private reduces
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that no public access is granted.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket permissions to disable public access.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access to only authorized users.
