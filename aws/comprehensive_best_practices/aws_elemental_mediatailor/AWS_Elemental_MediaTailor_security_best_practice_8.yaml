    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of data exposure and aligns with the principle of least privilege.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Confirm that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings on the bucket.
    - If public access is required, ensure that it is explicitly defined and justified
      within the bucket policy.
