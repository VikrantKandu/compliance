    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access or modify data.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Step 5: Check the bucket's Access Control List (ACL) to verify that it is not
        publicly accessible.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
        <bucket-name> to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Step 3: Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements granting public access.
    - Step 4: Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Enable the 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket to prevent
        future public access configurations.
