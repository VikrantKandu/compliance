    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with data
      protection regulations. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Access' column for each bucket to ensure it is not marked as 'Public'.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure that public access is restricted.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and access the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and select 'Block Public Access'.
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Re-evaluate the need for public access and apply the least privilege principle.
