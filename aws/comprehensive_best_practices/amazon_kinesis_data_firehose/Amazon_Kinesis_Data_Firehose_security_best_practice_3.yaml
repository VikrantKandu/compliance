    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should
      be restricted to prevent data breaches and comply with security best practices.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Unauthorized users could access,
      modify, or delete data, leading to data loss, breaches, or compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket BUCKET_NAME
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to
      restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access to the bucket.
