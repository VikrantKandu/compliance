    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, security, and compliance with
      organizational standards.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can lead to security vulnerabilities, inconsistent
      configurations, and non-compliance with organizational policies. Approved AMIs
      are vetted for security and compliance, ensuring that instances are secure and
      standardized.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - Review the AMI ID of each running instance.
    - Cross-reference these AMI IDs with the list of approved AMIs maintained by your
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI available
      to the user.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Stop the instance and create a snapshot of the current state if necessary.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate necessary data and configurations to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance if no longer needed.
