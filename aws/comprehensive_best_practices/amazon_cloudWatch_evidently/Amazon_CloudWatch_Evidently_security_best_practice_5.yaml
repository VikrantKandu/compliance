    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from being exposed to the internet. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block Public Access."
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
