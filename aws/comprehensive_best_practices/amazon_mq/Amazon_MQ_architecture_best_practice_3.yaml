    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password
      and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece
      of information only they should know or have immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended to prevent unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Review the MFA column to ensure
      that MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console
      at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users.
      4. Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials
      tab. 6. In the Multi-factor Authentication section, choose Manage. 7. Follow
      the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device.
