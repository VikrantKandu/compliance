    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access permissions
      enabled. This ensures that sensitive data stored in S3 is not exposed to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and bucket policies.
    - Ensure that no bucket allows public access through the "Block Public Access"
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - For each bucket, click on "Permissions".
    - Enable "Block all public access" if it is not already enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies to ensure they do not allow public access.
