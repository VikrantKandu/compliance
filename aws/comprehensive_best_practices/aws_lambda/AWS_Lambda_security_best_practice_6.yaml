    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure compliance with security and operational standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are built with security,
      compliance, and operational best practices in mind, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities
      and ensuring consistency across the environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'AMI ID' and verify it against the list of approved
      AMIs.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances to retrieve
      the AMI IDs for all instances and compare them with the approved list.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI, including unapproved
      ones.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Create a snapshot of the current instance state if needed.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate necessary data and configurations to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance after ensuring the new instance is fully
      operational.
