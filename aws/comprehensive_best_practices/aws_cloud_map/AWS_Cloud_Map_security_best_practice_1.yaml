    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and potential exposure of sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps maintain data security and compliance with
      data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket is configured with a policy that allows public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to run the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status and
      check the PublicAccessBlockConfiguration settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
