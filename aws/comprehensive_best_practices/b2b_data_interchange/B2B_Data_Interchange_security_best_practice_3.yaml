    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and security breaches. Ensuring that buckets
      are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings and ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
