    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Account Root User
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS account root user to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root user account significantly reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access, as it requires a second form of authentication. If MFA
      is not enabled, attackers can gain full control over the account using only
      the root credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the "Security Status" section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the AccountMFAEnabled field.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS account root user.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the "Security Status" section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account".
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Complete the MFA setup process by scanning the QR code or entering the secret
      key into your MFA device and then entering the generated code into the console.
