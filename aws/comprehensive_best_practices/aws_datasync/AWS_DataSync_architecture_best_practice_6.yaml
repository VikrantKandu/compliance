    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide not only a password but also a second
      form of verification, which significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a crucial security measure to protect
      AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password
      is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to the AWS resources. Enabling
      MFA mitigates this risk by requiring an additional factor for authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the "MFA" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users and select the user to enable MFA for.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage" and then "Activate MFA."
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
