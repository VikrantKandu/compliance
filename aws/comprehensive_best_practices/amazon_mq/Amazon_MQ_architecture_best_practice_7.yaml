    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public access can lead to accidental data leaks and exploitation
      by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy allowing public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Check for any public access settings using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure no public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove public access settings if necessary.
