  - ID: AWS-CLOUDTRAIL-001
  - Title: Enable CloudTrail in All Regions
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to provide a
      record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service.
  - Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions is crucial for security and operational
      auditing, risk management, and compliance. It ensures that all API calls are
      logged and can be reviewed in case of a security incident or for compliance
      purposes. Without CloudTrail, it would be difficult to track changes or identify
      unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      console. 3. Verify that a trail is created and is logging events in all regions.
      4. Ensure that the trail is configured to log both management and data events.
  - Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console.
      2. Click on 'Create trail' or select an existing trail to edit. 3. Ensure the
      trail is configured to apply to all regions. 4. Enable logging for both management
      and data events. 5. Save the changes to ensure CloudTrail is active in all regions.
