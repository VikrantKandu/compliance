    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present two
      or more separate forms of identification before they can access resources, reducing
      the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts even if credentials are compromised. Without MFA, an attacker
      with stolen credentials can easily access and manipulate resources, leading
      to potential data breaches and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user name.
    - Under the 'Security Credentials' tab, choose 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to activate and configure MFA for the user.
