    Title: Ensure EC2 Security Groups are Configured Correctly
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Security Groups in AWS EC2 should be configured to allow only necessary
      traffic. This involves restricting inbound and outbound rules to only what is
      required for the application or service.
    Rationale: Properly configured security groups minimize the attack surface by
      restricting unnecessary network access. Misconfigured security groups can lead
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Security Groups" from the left-hand menu.
    - Review each security group and ensure that inbound and outbound rules are limited
      to specific IP addresses and ports that are necessary for the application.
    - Verify that no security group is set to allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 unless
      absolutely necessary.
    Default Value: By default, new security groups do not have any inbound rules and
      allow all outbound traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the security group that is not compliant.
    - Modify the inbound and outbound rules to restrict traffic to only necessary
      IP addresses and ports.
    - Remove any rules that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 unless they are explicitly
      required and justified.
