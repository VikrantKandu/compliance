    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password.
      It requires users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a temporary
      code from their phone, when accessing AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if an attacker acquires a user's password, they can
      gain full access to the user's AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches
      or unauthorized changes.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
