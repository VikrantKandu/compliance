    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are private by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for public policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs for any public access permissions.
    - Remove any statements from the bucket policy that grant public access.
    - Modify ACLs to remove any public permissions.
    - Utilize AWS IAM roles and policies to grant access to specific users or services.
