    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by
      default reduces the risk of exposing data to the public internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket to ensure that they are not
      publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings of each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by using the command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket ACL to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to apply these changes and verify
      that the bucket is now private.
