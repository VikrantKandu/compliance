    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access. By ensuring buckets are not public, organizations can safeguard their
      data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACLs to confirm there are no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and block all public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
