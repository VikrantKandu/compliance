    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to the
      internet, increasing the risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
