    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible is
      crucial for maintaining data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Verify that the bucket is not set to public and does not have a policy allowing
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings or policies that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove public access with aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> --policy '{}'.
