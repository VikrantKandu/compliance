    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment. It requires users to provide multiple forms of identification
      before they can access AWS resources, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure to protect
      AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials
      are compromised, an attacker can gain full access to AWS resources, potentially
      leading to data breaches or misuse of services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA device' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
