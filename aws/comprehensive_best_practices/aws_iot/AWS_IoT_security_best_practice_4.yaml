    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to provide a second factor of authentication, enhancing the security of the
      root account which has full access to all resources in the AWS account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is crucial because it helps prevent
      unauthorized access to the account. The root account has unrestricted access
      to all resources and services, making it a prime target for attackers. Without
      MFA, a compromised password could lead to a complete breach of the account.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the account settings to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the AccountMFAEnabled value.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select 'Activate MFA' on the root account.
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the setup by entering the MFA codes generated by the device.
