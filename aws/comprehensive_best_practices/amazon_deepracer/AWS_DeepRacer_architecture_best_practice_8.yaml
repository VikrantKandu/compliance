    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and violations of privacy regulations. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and
      integrity.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and block public access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket in the AWS Management
      Console.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure they adhere to the principle
      of least privilege.
