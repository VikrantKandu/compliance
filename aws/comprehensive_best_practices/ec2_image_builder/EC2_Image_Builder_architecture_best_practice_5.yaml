    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and potential
      data leaks.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you mitigate the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure. Public access to buckets can result in data
      breaches, compliance violations, and loss of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly monitor S3 permissions to ensure compliance with best practices.
