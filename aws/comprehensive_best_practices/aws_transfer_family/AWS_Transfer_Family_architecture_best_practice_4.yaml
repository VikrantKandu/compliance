    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data leakage and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm all public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
