  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private to prevent unauthorized
      access. This involves configuring bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs)
      to restrict access.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protecting sensitive data
      from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and exposure of confidential information.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'. 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and navigate to the
      'Permissions' tab. 5. Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public
      access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may vary
      based on user actions.
  - Remediation: 1. If any bucket is found to be public, navigate to the 'Permissions'
      tab for that bucket. 2. Adjust the bucket policy to remove any public access
      permissions. 3. Modify the ACLs to ensure that only authorized users have access.
      4. Consider enabling bucket versioning and logging for additional security monitoring.
