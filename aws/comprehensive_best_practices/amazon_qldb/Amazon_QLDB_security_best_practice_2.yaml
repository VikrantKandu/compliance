    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires users
      to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the security of user access
      to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker could potentially gain full access to AWS resources. MFA adds an additional
      layer of protection, making it harder for attackers to succeed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Verify that "Assigned MFA device" is listed under "Multi-factor authentication".
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA device" and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device
      to the user.
