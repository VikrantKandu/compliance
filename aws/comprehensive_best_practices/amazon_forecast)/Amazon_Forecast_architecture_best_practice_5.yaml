    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual
      Private Cloud (VPC). Launching instances within a VPC provides enhanced security
      features and network control options.
    Rationale: Launching instances outside of a VPC can expose them to security risks
      such as unauthorized access and data breaches. VPCs provide network isolation
      and security controls that help protect your instances.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Verify that each instance is associated with a VPC by checking the VPC ID column.
    Default Value: By default, instances are launched within a default VPC if no specific
      VPC is chosen.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not within a VPC.
    - Plan a migration strategy to move these instances into a VPC.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instances and relaunch them within a VPC.
