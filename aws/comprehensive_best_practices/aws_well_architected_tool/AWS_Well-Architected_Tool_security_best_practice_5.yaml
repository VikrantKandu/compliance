    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that all AWS S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, ensuring that sensitive data is not publicly accessible. S3 buckets
      should have policies that restrict access to authorized users only.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - Ensure that each bucket's permissions are set to private and do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any policies that grant public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Consider enabling bucket versioning and logging for additional security.
