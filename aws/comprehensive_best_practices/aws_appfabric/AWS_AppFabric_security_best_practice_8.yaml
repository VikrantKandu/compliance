  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring that buckets are private minimizes the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that bucket policies and
      access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings on the account and for each bucket
      to prevent future public access.
