    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Test the bucket permissions to confirm that public access is disabled.
