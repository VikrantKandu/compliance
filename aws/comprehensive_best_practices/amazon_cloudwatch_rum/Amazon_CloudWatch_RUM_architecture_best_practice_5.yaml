  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets and their access policies. 4. For each bucket,
      check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure that public
      access is not granted. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically retrieve bucket policies and verify
      their settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Modify the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to remove any public access permissions. 5. Enable
      block public access settings for the bucket to prevent future public access
      configurations.
