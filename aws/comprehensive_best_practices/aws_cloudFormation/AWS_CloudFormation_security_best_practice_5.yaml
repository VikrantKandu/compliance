  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private to prevent
      unauthorized access. Public access should be explicitly granted only when necessary.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private minimizes the risk of unauthorized data
      exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data manipulation.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access unless explicitly required.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket permissions to remove public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Consider using AWS IAM policies to control access to the bucket.
