  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Restricting public access minimizes the risk of data
      leaks and unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
      4. Verify that no buckets are set to allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab
      and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access. 5. Use AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access as needed.
