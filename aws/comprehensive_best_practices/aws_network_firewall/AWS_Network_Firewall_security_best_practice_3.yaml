    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict public
      access to prevent data breaches and maintain data privacy.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to accidental data leaks and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by
      default reduces the risk of data exposure and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
