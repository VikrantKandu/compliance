    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data and maintain compliance with data protection standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
