    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. The best practice is
      to configure bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive
      information and complies with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      verify ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify the bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to restrict access.
    - Remove any public ACLs that grant public read or write permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
