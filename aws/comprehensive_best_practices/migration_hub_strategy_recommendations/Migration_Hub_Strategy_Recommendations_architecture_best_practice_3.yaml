    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check to ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      private by default reduces the risk of data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACLs do not grant public read or write permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check the bucket ACLs and policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Adjust bucket ACLs to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
