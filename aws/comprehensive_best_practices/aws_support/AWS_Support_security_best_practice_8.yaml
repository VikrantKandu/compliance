    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the
      risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that no bucket policy grants public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable "Block all public access" in the S3 console for each bucket.
    - Action 2: Review and modify bucket policies to remove public access permissions.
    - Action 3: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to restrict access to
        authorized users only.
