  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Groups
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not using the default security
      group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can expose instances to unnecessary risk.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      instances to the internet or other network segments. This can increase the risk
      of unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, check the associated
      security groups. 5. Ensure none of the instances are using the default security
      group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored to the
      instance's needs. 3. Associate the new security group with the instance and
      disassociate the default security group.
