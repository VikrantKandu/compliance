    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an extra
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's password
      could potentially compromise the account, leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      changes to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA enabled' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
