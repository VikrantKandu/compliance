    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not directly accessible
      from the internet. Publicly accessible instances can be vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and attacks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible EC2 instances increase the risk of unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Ensuring instances are not publicly accessible
      helps to protect sensitive data and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the 'Instances' option from the sidebar.
    - Review the 'Public IP' column for each instance to determine if they have public
      IP addresses.
    - Check the associated security groups to ensure they do not allow inbound traffic
      from 0.0.0.0/0.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with public IP addresses,
      depending on the subnet settings.
    Remediation:
    - If an instance has a public IP, consider removing it or associating it with
      a private IP.
    - Modify the security group rules to restrict inbound traffic to specific IP addresses
      or ranges.
    - Use a bastion host or VPN to access instances securely if necessary.
