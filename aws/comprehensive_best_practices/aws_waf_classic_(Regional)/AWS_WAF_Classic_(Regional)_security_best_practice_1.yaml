    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched with the latest Amazon
      Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using the latest AMI ensures that EC2 instances have the most recent
      security patches and updates, reducing vulnerabilities and potential attack
      vectors. Failure to use updated AMIs can leave instances susceptible to known
      vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and check the AMI ID for each running instance.
    - Compare the AMI IDs with the latest available AMIs from the AWS Marketplace
      or your own AMI repository.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified
      during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using the latest AMI.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate workloads from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance once migration is complete.
