    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled. Enabling encryption at rest for S3 buckets ensures that data is protected
      from unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data and
      meet compliance requirements. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and exposure, especially in the event of a security breach.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to its properties.
    - Check if 'Default encryption' is enabled under the 'Server-side encryption'
      section.
    - Repeat for all S3 buckets.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not encrypted by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Server-side encryption', select 'Edit'.
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save changes to enable default encryption for the bucket.
