    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket allows public access through bucket policies or Access
      Control Lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
