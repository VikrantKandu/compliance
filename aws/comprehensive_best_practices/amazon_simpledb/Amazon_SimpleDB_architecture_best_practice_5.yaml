    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized access. If buckets are publicly accessible, sensitive data
      can be exposed to anyone on the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have a policy or ACL that allows public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
