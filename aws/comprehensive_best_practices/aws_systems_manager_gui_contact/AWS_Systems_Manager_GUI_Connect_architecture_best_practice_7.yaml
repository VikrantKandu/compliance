    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, security, and compliance
      across the environment.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities, inconsistencies,
      and compliance issues. Approved AMIs are vetted for security and compliance
      requirements, reducing the risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, note the AMI ID used to launch the instance.
    - Verify that the AMI ID is listed in the approved AMI list maintained by your
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate data and workloads to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance.
