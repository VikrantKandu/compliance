    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets should
      not allow public access unless explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting public access minimizes the risk of data leaks and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs). 4. Ensure
      that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI or SDKs
      to verify the bucket's access settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Modify the bucket policy
      to remove public access permissions. 5. Update the bucket ACLs to restrict public
      access. 6. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
