    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication in addition
      to the standard username and password. This best practice involves enabling
      MFA for all IAM users to protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of account compromise as
      it requires an additional verification step. Without MFA, if an attacker gains
      access to a user's credentials, they can potentially access AWS resources and
      data. Implementing MFA helps mitigate this risk by requiring a second form of
      authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all users listed.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, click on Manage for Assigned MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate a virtual MFA device for the user.
