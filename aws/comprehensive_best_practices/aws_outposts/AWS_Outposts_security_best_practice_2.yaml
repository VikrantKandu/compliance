    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. It is crucial to
      restrict access to only trusted entities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to verify that public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      policy via the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access, but users can
      change this setting.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only specific IAM users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
