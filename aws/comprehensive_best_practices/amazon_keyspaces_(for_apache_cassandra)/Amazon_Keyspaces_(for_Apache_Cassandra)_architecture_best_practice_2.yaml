    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks and protects
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy or ACL allows public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and not publicly
      accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the relevant bucket.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Remove any policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to enforce restrictions.
