    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of verification in addition to
      a password. This helps to protect your account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, an attacker only needs a password to gain access to
      your AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the presence of an MFA device
      in the 'MFA Device' column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
