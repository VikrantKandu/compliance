  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Public access
      to buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data
      access, leading to potential data breaches, data loss, and exposure of sensitive
      information. Ensuring buckets are private helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket. 4. Verify that there are no bucket policies
      or access control lists (ACLs) that grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket you want to secure. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable
      "Block all public access" to prevent public access to the bucket. 5. Review
      and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
