    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read or write access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of data exposure and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public read or write access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to review bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure that no public access is granted.
    - Regularly review S3 bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
