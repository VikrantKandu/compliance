    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the ACL settings to ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access configurations.
