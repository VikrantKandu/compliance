  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and check the 'Access' column for public indicators.
      4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open its properties. 5. Under
      'Permissions', check the 'Bucket Policy' and 'Access Control List (ACL)' for
      public access settings. 6. Ensure that the bucket does not have public access
      unless necessary.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs remediation. 4. Click on 'Permissions'. 5. Remove
      any public access settings from the 'Bucket Policy' and 'Access Control List
      (ACL)'. 6. Implement bucket policies that restrict access to specific users
      or roles.
