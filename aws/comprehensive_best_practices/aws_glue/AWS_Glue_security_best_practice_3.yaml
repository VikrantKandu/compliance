    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users who have a console password. MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a one-time
      code from a device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts, even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are
      more vulnerable to phishing attacks and credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and verify MFA status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the wizard to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
