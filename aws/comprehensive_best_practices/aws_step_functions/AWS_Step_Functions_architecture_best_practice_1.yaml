    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access, which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting public access minimizes the risk of data leaks and
      ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Check the "Permissions" tab to ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove
      public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
