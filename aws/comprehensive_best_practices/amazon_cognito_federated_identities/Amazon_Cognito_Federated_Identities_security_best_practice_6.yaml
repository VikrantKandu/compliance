    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access settings.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
