    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as unauthorized
      users can access and potentially manipulate or steal data. Ensuring buckets
      are private is crucial for data security and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a public access policy.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket ACLs.
    - Check for public access settings using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any policies that allow public access.
    - Restrict bucket access to specific IAM roles or users as needed.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
