    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security. MFA adds
      an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access by
      requiring a second form of authentication. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to compromise via phishing attacks or password theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
