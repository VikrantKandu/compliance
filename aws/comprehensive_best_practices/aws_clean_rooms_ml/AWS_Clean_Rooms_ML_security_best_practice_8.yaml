  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect data from being
      exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to gain access to sensitive information, leading to potential data
      breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Verify that
      the bucket's ACL does not grant public read or write permissions. 6. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy to remove public access permissions. 2. Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure
      it does not grant public read or write permissions. 3. Utilize the S3 Block
      Public Access feature to block public access at the bucket level.
