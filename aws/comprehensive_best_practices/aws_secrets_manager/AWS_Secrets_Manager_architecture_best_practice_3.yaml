    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS S3 buckets are private by default
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. S3 buckets should not allow
      public access unless explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Keeping buckets private by default minimizes
      the risk of accidental exposure.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each
        bucket.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check ACL settings and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: AWS S3 buckets are private by default unless configured otherwise
      by the user.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Step 4: Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Step 5: Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access
        is granted unless explicitly required.
