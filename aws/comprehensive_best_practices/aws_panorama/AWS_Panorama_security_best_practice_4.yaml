    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      data manipulation, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private
      by default reduces the risk of sensitive information being accessed by unauthorized
      users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and examine the permissions settings for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure that no public
      access is granted.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list and check the
      bucket policies and ACLs for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
