    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      which poses a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are private helps
      protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by ensuring there
      are no public access permissions set.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Enable 'Block All Public Access' in the bucket settings.
