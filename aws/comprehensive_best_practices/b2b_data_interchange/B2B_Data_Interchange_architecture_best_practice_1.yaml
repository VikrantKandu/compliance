  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      protects data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access
      settings enabled. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify ACLs do not grant public access. 5. Check bucket policies
      using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the AWS S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly
      accessible. 3. Update the bucket permissions to remove any public access. 4.
      Modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to only authorized users.
      5. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
