    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and pose a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches,
      loss of confidentiality, and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that
      public access is blocked. 4. Review the bucket policy and access control list
      (ACL) to confirm that they do not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and click
      on "Block public access." 4. Enable all options to block public access and save
      the changes. 5. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      permissions.
