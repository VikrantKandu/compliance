    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security to the
      AWS environment by requiring a second form of authentication in addition to
      the standard username and password. This helps protect against unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials. Without
      MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, unauthorized users can gain
      full access to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches, data loss,
      or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the presence of an MFA device
      in the "Security credentials" tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA" and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device.
