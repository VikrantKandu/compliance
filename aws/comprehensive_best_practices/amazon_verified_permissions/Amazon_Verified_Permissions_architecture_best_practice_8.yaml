  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized data access.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the
      account or bucket level.
