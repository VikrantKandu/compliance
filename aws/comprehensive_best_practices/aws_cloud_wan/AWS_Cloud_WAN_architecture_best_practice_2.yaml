    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches or compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
      By restricting public access, you reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and ACL do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically verify the ACL settings.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Review the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not allow public
      access. 2. If public access is not required, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL. 3. Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature
      to prevent public access to the bucket. 4. Regularly review and audit bucket
      permissions to ensure compliance with security best practices.
