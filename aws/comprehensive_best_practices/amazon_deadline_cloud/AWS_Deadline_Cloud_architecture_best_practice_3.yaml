    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only
      a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e.,
      a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand - such
      as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the AWS account, and its compromise can lead to severe security breaches,
      including data loss, data leakage, and service disruption.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the root account. 5. Check
      the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM dashboard. 3. In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Activate
      MFA'. 4. Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device. 5. Complete the setup by verifying the MFA device.
