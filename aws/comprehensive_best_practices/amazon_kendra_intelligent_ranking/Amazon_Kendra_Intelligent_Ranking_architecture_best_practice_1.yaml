    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of security for accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, as it requires a second form of verification beyond
      just a password. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to password-related
      attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list users, and
      then aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices for
      each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
