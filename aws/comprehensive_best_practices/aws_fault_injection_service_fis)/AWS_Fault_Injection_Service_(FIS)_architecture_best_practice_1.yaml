    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data leaks and compromise
      the integrity of the data stored within.
    Audit:
    - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
