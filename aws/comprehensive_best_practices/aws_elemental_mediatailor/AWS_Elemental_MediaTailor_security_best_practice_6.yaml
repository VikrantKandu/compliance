  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled. Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information and complies
      with data protection regulations.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption for S3 buckets protects data from unauthorized
      access and potential breaches. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in
      S3 is vulnerable to exposure in case of unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Properties" tab. 4. Under "Default encryption,"
      verify that server-side encryption is enabled. 5. Repeat for all buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is not compliant. 3. Click on the "Properties" tab
      and go to the "Default encryption" section. 4. Choose "Enable" and select the
      desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS). 5. Save changes and ensure
      that all future objects uploaded to the bucket are encrypted.
