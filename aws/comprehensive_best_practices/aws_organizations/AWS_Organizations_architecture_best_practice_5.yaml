    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are
      private helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Restricting access minimizes the risk of data exposure and ensures
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the S3 console for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
