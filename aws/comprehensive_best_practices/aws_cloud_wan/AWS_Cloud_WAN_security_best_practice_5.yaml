    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be launched in the default VPC to ensure
      better control over the network configuration and security settings. Using custom
      VPCs allows for more granular control over network traffic and routing, which
      enhances security.
    Rationale: Launching instances in the default VPC can lead to a lack of control
      over network configurations, potentially exposing instances to unnecessary risk.
      Custom VPCs provide the ability to define specific security groups, network
      ACLs, and routing tables, reducing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Go to the "Instances" section.
    - Check the VPC column for each instance to ensure it is not using the default
      VPC.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched in the default VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom VPC with specific security configurations.
    - Launch new EC2 instances within this custom VPC.
    - Migrate existing instances from the default VPC to the custom VPC, ensuring
      all configurations are properly adjusted.
