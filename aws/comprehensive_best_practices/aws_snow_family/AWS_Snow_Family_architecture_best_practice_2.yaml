  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access,
      which is a significant security risk.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring S3 buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure all public access is blocked. 5. Verify that no bucket
      policies or access control lists (ACLs) grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console. 2. Under the
      "Permissions" tab, enable "Block all public access." 3. Review and remove any
      bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access. 4. Use the AWS CLI or SDKs
      to automate the enforcement of these settings across your AWS environment.
