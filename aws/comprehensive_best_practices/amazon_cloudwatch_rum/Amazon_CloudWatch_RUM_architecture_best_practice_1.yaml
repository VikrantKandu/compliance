    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information
      and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions to ensure that there are no public access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
