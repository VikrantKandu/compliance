    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by
      default helps protect sensitive information and complies with security best
      practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions of each bucket to ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Verify bucket policies and ACLs to confirm they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket permissions and verify public access
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Review the permissions of all S3 buckets.
    - Remove any public access permissions from bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access configurations.
