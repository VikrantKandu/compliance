    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could potentially expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks by restricting access to only authorized users.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions. 4. Ensure that the
      bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Check the bucket settings to
      ensure 'Block Public Access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and select the S3 service. 2.
      Choose the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on 'Permissions' and
      update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable
      'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket. 5. Save changes and verify that
      the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
