    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the "Public access settings" for each bucket.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to S3 and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
