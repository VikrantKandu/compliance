    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication, which helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enforcing MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who
      obtains a user's password can gain full access to their permissions, leading
      to potential data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on each user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device to the user.
