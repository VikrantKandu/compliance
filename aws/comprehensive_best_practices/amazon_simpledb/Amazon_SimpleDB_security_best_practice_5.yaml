    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security by requiring an additional layer of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA,
      compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access and potential data
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
