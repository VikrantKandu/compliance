    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access or manipulate sensitive data. Implementing this check reduces the
      risk of data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and ensure that public access settings are
      disabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify that no public access
      is granted.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access using aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Remove any public access policies or ACLs associated with the bucket.
    - Consider enabling the "Block all public access" feature for additional security.
