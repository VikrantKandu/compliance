    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps protect data stored
      in S3 by encrypting it on the server side before saving it to disk and decrypting
      it when accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets protects sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. If server-side encryption
      is not enabled, data stored in S3 buckets may be exposed to unauthorized access
      and misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the "Properties" tab for "Default Encryption" settings.
    - Verify that "Server-side encryption" is enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket for which you want to enable server-side encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default Encryption," select "Enable" and choose the appropriate encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption to the bucket.
