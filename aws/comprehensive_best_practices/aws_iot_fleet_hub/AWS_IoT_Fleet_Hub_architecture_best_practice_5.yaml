    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      breaches if sensitive data is stored in them.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. It is important to
      restrict access and only allow public access when absolutely necessary and after
      careful consideration.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the Permissions tab. 4. Check the 'Block Public
      Access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked. 5. Review the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm that they do not grant public
      access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access at the account level
      unless overridden.
    Remediation: 1. If public access is not required, enable 'Block all public access'
      in the bucket permissions. 2. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow
      public access. 3. Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure
      compliance with security best practices.
