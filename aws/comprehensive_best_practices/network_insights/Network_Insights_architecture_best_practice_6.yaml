    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive information and maintain
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - Confirm that all buckets have the "Block Public Access" settings enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Save changes to apply the updated configuration.
