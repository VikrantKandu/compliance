    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two forms of authentication.
      This enhances the security of user credentials and helps prevent unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker
      with stolen credentials can easily access and manipulate resources, leading
      to potential data breaches and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for the 'MFA' column in the
      user list.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to check MFA devices for each
        user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user name.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
