    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks
      and protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions to ensure that 'Block all public access'
      is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is checked.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy: aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket
        <bucket-name> --policy <policy-json>.
