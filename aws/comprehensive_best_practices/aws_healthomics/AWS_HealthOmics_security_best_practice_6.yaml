    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets do not have public access permissions
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings and ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings on each bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to automate the enforcement of non-public access configurations.
