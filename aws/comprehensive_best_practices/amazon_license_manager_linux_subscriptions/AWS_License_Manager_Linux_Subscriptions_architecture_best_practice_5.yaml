    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access to ensure
      that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the affected bucket.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
