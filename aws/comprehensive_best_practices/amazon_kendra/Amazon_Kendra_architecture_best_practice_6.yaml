    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to only
      necessary users and services minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Public' access status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access by reviewing the
      policy using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and not publicly
      accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy or
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings.
    - Apply bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
