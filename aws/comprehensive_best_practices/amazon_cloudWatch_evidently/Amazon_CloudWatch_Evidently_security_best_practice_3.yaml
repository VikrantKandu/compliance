    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using the latest Amazon
      Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been patched in newer versions. Ensuring the use of the latest AMIs helps maintain
      security and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances to view the list of running instances.
    - Check the AMI ID associated with each instance.
    - Compare the AMI IDs with the latest available AMIs in the AWS Marketplace or
      your own AMI catalog.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless explicitly
      specified during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running on outdated AMIs.
    - Plan for an update by creating new instances with the latest AMI.
    - Terminate the old instances after verifying the new instances are operational
      and configured correctly.
