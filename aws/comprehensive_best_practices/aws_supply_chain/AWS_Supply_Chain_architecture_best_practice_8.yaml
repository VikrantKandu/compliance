    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer
      of security beyond just a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. If MFA is not enabled, unauthorized users can gain access to AWS
      resources, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA device' is assigned under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users and verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, click on the user name.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device to the user.
