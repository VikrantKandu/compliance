    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to see if MFA is enabled for all IAM users.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list all users
        and aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each user to verify
        MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA device" and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
    - Ensure all IAM users have MFA enabled by repeating the process for each user.
