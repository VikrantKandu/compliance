    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized data
      access, and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious users, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and check the bucket permissions.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 3: Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access".
    - Step 4: Review and update any bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access
        permissions.
    - Step 5: Save the changes and verify the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
