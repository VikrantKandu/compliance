    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be accessed by anyone on the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks, unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a public access policy or ACL allowing public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, remove any public permissions from the bucket
      policy and ACL.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings in the S3 console to block all public access
      to the bucket.
    - Re-evaluate and adjust bucket policies to ensure compliance with organizational
      security requirements.
