    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to provide two or more authentication factors to gain access, significantly
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the AWS root account is crucial because this account
      has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS environment. Without MFA,
      if the root account credentials are compromised, it could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the Security Status section on the IAM dashboard.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the Security Status section, select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA
      device.
