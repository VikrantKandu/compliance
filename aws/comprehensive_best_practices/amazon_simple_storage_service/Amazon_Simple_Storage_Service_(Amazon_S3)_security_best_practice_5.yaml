    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised accounts
      by requiring a second form of verification. Without MFA, unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts can occur if passwords are leaked or guessed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - Check the "MFA" column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - Click on the specific user name.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," choose "Manage" and follow the instructions to
      enable MFA.
    - Ensure all users have MFA enabled by repeating this process.
