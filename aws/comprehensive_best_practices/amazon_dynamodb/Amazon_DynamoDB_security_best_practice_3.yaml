    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an additional layer of
      security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms of identification
      before gaining access to AWS resources, thereby reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances security by requiring
      a second factor of authentication, making it more difficult for unauthorized
      users to gain access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials
      are compromised, an attacker can easily access and manipulate resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each IAM user to review
      their security settings. 5. Check if MFA is enabled for each user by verifying
      the 'MFA Device' status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the instructions
      to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
