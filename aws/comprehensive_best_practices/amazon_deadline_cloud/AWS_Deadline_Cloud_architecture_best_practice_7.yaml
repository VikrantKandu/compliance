    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) users in your AWS account to enhance security
      by requiring an additional authentication factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring
      a second form of authentication. This helps protect against unauthorized access,
      even if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
