    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves ensuring that bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public read or write access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private reduces the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions set.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy for each bucket to ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have public access permissions unless
      explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Utilize the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
