    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Bucket Policies
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have bucket policies applied
      to manage access permissions. Bucket policies are crucial for defining who can
      access the data and what actions they can perform, helping to secure sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Without bucket policies, S3 buckets may be inadvertently exposed to
      unauthorized access or modifications. This could lead to data breaches or data
      loss, impacting the security and integrity of the data stored within the buckets.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and select a bucket to inspect.
    - Check the "Permissions" tab to verify if a bucket policy is applied.
    - Ensure the policy grants least privilege access and does not expose the bucket
      publicly unless necessary.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have bucket policies applied.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket requiring a policy.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Bucket Policy Editor."
    - Write and apply a bucket policy that restricts access to only authorized users
      or roles.
    - Test the policy to ensure it meets security requirements and does not allow
      public access unless explicitly intended.
