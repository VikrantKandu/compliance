    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets may expose data
      to the internet, leading to data leakage and compliance issues.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Check the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the AWS Management Console and access the S3 service.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that requires remediation.
    - Step 3: Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Adjust the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Step 5: Enable 'Block Public Access' settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
