    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Public buckets can be exploited by attackers
      to exfiltrate or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the 'Access' column for public access indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and check for
        public grants.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Edit' under 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review bucket policies and remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private
        to set the bucket to private.
