  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy
      and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions. 2. Use the AWS Management
      Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket's settings. 3. Regularly review bucket
      permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
