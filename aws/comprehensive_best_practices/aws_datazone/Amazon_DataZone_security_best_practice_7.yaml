    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      can gain full access to the AWS account and potentially cause data breaches,
      financial losses, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select each user and check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
