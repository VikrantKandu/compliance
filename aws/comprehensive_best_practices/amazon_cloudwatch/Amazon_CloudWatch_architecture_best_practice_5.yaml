    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, leading to data leaks or unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Check the bucket permissions to ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to automate the enforcement of non-public access policies.
