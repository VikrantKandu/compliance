    Title: Ensure EC2 instances have a security group assigned
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances have at least one security
      group assigned. Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your instance
      to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    Rationale: Assigning security groups to EC2 instances is crucial for defining
      access controls and ensuring only authorized traffic can reach your instances.
      Without a security group, instances are vulnerable to unauthorized access and
      potential security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security Groups' column to verify that at least
      one security group is associated.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the output for the 'SecurityGroups' attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may not have a security group explicitly
      assigned.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For any instance without a security group, click 'Actions', then 'Networking',
      and 'Change Security Groups'.
    - Assign an appropriate security group to the instance.
    - Ensure the security group has the necessary rules to allow required traffic
      while restricting unauthorized access.
