    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose significant security risks, including
      data exposure and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      sensitive information and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control settings.
    - Verify that 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for the bucket.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
