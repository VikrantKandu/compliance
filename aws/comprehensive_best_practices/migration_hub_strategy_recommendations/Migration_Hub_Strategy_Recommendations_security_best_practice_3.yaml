    Title: Ensure S3 Bucket Versioning is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets ensures that multiple versions
      of an object are retained, providing protection against accidental overwrites
      or deletions.
    Rationale: Versioning allows you to recover from unintended user actions and application
      failures. Without versioning, data loss can occur, leading to potential business
      disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Versioning" is set to "Enabled" for each bucket.
    Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default on S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket for which you want to enable versioning.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Click on "Edit" in the Versioning section and enable it.
