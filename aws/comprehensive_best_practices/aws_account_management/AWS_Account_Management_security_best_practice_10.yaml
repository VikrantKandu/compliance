    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the login process for AWS users by requiring a second form of authentication
      in addition to the password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, if an account's password is compromised, the account can be easily
      accessed by attackers.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left pane, click on "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left pane, click on "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, click "Assign MFA device".
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA for the user.
