    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can lead to data exposure and security
      vulnerabilities. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps in
      maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket. 4. Confirm that
      'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not grant public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable 'Block all
      public access' under 'Block Public Access settings'. 5. Review and update the
      bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
