    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data breaches,
      loss of sensitive information, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a public access setting unless explicitly required.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any public access policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket ACL.
    - Modify or remove any bucket policies that grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to all buckets
      in your account by default.
