    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data
      to the internet, leading to compliance violations and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      no public access is granted.
