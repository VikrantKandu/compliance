    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public read or write
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized exposure and mitigates the risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public read or write permissions enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that has public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable bucket policies or IAM roles to grant specific access to authorized users
      only.
