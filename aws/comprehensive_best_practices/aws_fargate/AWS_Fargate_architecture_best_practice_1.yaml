    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides a safeguard
      against unauthorized access by encrypting data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and meets compliance requirements. Without encryption, data stored in
      S3 may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Check under 'Default encryption' to verify if server-side encryption is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Default encryption', choose 'Enable' and select an encryption method
      (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save changes to apply server-side encryption to the bucket.
