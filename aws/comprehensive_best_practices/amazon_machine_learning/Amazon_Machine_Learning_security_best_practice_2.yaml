    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from being exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings.
    - Implement S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
