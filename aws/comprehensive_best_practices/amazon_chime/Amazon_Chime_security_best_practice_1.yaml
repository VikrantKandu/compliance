    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be launched in the default VPC to ensure
      proper network segmentation and security controls. Using custom VPCs allows
      for fine-grained control over network configurations and security settings.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in the default VPC can lead to insufficient
      network security and a lack of control over traffic flows. Custom VPCs provide
      better security through customizable network configurations, which can help
      mitigate risks such as unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left panel. 4. Review the VPC ID associated with
      each instance. 5. Verify that the VPC ID does not match the default VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC if no
      other VPC is specified.
    Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances running in the default VPC. 2. Stop the
      instance and create a snapshot of the root volume. 3. Launch a new instance
      in a custom VPC using the snapshot. 4. Update security groups and network configurations
      as necessary. 5. Terminate the instance in the default VPC once the new instance
      is verified.
