    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring
      a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access in
      case of compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column for 'Enabled' status.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the specific user.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the steps to assign an MFA device to the user.
