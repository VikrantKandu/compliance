    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles Instead of Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles instead of directly
      to users. This practice simplifies management and enhances security by ensuring
      that permissions are granted based on roles or group memberships.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex and error-prone
      permission structures. Using groups or roles makes it easier to manage permissions
      and reduces the risk of excessive or unintended access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "Permissions" tab to see if any policies are directly
      attached.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-attached-user-policies
      --user-name <username>` to list policies attached to a user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups,
      or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Identify users with directly attached policies.
    - Create appropriate IAM groups or roles.
    - Attach the identified policies to the created groups or roles.
    - Add the users to the groups or assign the roles to the users.
    - Remove the directly attached policies from the users.
