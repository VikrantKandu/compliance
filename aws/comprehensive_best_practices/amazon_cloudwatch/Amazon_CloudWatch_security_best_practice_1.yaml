    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data leaks, unauthorized
      data manipulation, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private by
      default reduces these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly monitor and audit bucket access permissions to ensure compliance.
