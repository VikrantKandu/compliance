    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with default security groups
      as these groups typically allow unrestricted inbound access, posing a security
      risk.
    Rationale: Default security groups often allow unrestricted access, which can
      expose instances to unauthorized access and potential attacks. Ensuring that
      instances use custom security groups with specific rules reduces this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Click on "Instances" and review each instance's associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with a default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance's requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with the instance and disassociate the default
      security group.
