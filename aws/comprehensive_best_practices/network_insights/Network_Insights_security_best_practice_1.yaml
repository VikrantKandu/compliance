    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks and protects
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the bucket's policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings to restrict
      public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets
      to prevent public access.
