  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks
      and complies with security best practices.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Remove any statements in the bucket policy that allow public access.
    - Set the bucket ACL to private.
    - Utilize the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
