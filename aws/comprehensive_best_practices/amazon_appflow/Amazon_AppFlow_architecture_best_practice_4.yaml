    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Do Not Have Public IPs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances do not have public IP addresses
      unless specifically required. Public IP addresses can expose instances to the
      internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and attacks.
    Rationale: Assigning public IP addresses to EC2 instances can lead to potential
      security risks as they are directly accessible from the internet. This exposure
      increases the likelihood of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential
      attacks. By restricting public IPs, you enhance the security posture of your
      AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Instances' from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - Step 4: Review the 'Public IP' column for each instance.
    - Step 5: Verify that instances do not have public IP addresses unless explicitly
        required.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are assigned public IPs by default if the subnet
      is configured to assign them automatically.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Identify instances with public IPs that do not require them.
    - Action 2: Modify the instance's network interface to remove the public IP address.
    - Action 3: Ensure subnets are configured not to automatically assign public IPs
        unless necessary.
    - Action 4: Consider using a NAT Gateway or Bastion Host for necessary internet
        access.
