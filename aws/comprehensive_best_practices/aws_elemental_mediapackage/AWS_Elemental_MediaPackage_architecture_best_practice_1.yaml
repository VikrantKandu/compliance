    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of identification beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure. Without
      MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access through compromised
      passwords. MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, protecting
      sensitive data and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM Dashboard, select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the username of the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
