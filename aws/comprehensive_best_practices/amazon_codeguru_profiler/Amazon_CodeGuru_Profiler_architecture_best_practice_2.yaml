  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Default Encryption Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect sensitive data at rest.
  - Rationale: Enabling default encryption on S3 buckets ensures that all objects
      stored in the bucket are automatically encrypted, reducing the risk of data
      exposure. Without encryption, data can be accessed in plaintext by unauthorized
      users if a security breach occurs.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the properties to see if default encryption is enabled.
      4. Verify that the encryption settings specify a valid encryption algorithm
      such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have default encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket you need to configure. 3. Go to the bucket properties
      and find the "Default encryption" section. 4. Enable default encryption and
      select an encryption method like AES-256 or AWS-KMS. 5. Save the changes to
      ensure all future objects are encrypted by default.
