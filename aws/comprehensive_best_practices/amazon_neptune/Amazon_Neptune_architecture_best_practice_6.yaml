    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not public helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 console or CLI to modify the permissions and ensure the bucket
      is private.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access and use IAM roles
      for controlled access.
