    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of verification, such as a temporary
      code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If a user's password is compromised, MFA acts as an additional
      barrier, preventing attackers from gaining control of the account.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
      <username> for each user to check MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      and activate an MFA device for the user.
