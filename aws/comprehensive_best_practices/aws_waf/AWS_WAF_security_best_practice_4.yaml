    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access
      to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps to protect AWS user accounts from unauthorized access.
      If an account's password is compromised, MFA provides an additional barrier
      against account misuse. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing
      attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, AWS IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user account.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device to the user.
