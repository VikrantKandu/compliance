  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      a second form of authentication in addition to the password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's password can
      easily access the account. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      an additional authentication factor.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check if MFA is enabled
      by looking for the "MFA" column in the user list. 5. Alternatively, use the
      AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' and 'aws iam list-mfa-devices' to verify
      MFA devices.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Assigned
      MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the steps to assign a virtual MFA device
      or a hardware MFA device to the user.
