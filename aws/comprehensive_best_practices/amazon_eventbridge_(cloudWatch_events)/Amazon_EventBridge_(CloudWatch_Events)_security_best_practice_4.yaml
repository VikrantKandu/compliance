    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be launched in the default VPC to ensure
      proper network segmentation and security controls.
    Rationale: Using the default VPC may lead to inadequate network configuration
      and security controls, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left panel.
    - Check the 'VPC ID' column for each instance.
    - Verify that the VPC ID is not the default VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched in the default VPC unless
      specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running in the default VPC.
    - Create a new VPC with appropriate security settings.
    - Stop the instances running in the default VPC.
    - Launch new instances in the newly created VPC.
    - Terminate the instances in the default VPC once migration is complete.
