    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. Limiting access
      to only authorized users minimizes the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to verify that public access is restricted.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs to confirm
      no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" under the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Test access to ensure that only authorized users can access the bucket.
