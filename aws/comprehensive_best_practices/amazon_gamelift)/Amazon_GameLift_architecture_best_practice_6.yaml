    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data
      to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to maintaining the
      confidentiality and integrity of data stored in AWS. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access, posing significant security
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs)
      to verify they do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to override any public access granted
      through bucket policies or ACLs.
