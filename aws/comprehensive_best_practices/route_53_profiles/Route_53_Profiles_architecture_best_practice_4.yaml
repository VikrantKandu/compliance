    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that all public access options
      are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
