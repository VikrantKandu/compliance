    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can
      mitigate the risk of unauthorized data access and potential breaches. Public
      access can lead to exposure of sensitive data and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket is set to allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Disable public access by adjusting the bucket ACL and removing any public read/write
      permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM roles or AWS services.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
