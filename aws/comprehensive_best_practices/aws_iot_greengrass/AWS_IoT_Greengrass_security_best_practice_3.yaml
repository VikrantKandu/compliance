    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect against
      unauthorized access and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket access control list (ACL) to ensure it is not granting public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access to the bucket.
