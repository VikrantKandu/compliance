    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public accessibility can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored
      in the bucket.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring that buckets are not public helps maintain data confidentiality and
      integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure that the bucket is
      not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to check for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and permissions to remove public access.
    - Consider enabling block public access settings for the bucket to prevent future
      public access.
