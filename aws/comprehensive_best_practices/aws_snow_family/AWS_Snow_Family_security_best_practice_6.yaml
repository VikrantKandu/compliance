    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access to ensure
      sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. This involves setting bucket
      policies and ACLs to restrict access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of accidental
      data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL settings do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify permissions or use CLI commands to
      update settings.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access
      can be granted.
