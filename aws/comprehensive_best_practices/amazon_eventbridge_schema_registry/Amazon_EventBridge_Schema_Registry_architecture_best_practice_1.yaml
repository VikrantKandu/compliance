    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring
      that buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive data and comply
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket permissions and remove any
      public access.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access to specific IAM users or
      roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or specific buckets to
      prevent public access.
