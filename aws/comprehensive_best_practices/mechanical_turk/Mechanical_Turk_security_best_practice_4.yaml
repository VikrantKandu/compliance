    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access enabled,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as sensitive
      information may be exposed to the internet. Restricting access to authenticated
      users mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access
      configurations.
