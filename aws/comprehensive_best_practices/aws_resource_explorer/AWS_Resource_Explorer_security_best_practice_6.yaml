    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be restricted to prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with security
      policies.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data, resulting in potential data breaches and non-compliance with
      data protection regulations. Restricting public access minimizes the risk of
      exposing confidential information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that should not be publicly accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent public access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
