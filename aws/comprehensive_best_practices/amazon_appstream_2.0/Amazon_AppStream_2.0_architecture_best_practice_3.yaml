  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized access to sensitive
      information, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Verify that the settings do not allow public access. Specifically, check that
      the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have "Block all public access" enabled.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access (bucket settings)".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
