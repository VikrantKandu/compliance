    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data leaks and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet. By ensuring buckets are private, organizations can safeguard their
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Confirm that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL).
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access if necessary.
