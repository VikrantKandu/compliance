    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access,
      data breaches, and potential financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the Security credentials tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to check
      the MFA status for all users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users and choose the user for which you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, click on Manage next to Assigned MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
