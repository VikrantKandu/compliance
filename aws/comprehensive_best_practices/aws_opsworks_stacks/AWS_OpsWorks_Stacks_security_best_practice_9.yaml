    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized public access to sensitive data. By default,
      S3 buckets are private, but misconfigurations can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access, which can result in sensitive information being exposed. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates this risk and aligns with best security practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access'
      settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket's ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions granted to the bucket or its
      objects.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public
      access.
