    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and choose the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on "Permissions" and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to
      restrict public access.
