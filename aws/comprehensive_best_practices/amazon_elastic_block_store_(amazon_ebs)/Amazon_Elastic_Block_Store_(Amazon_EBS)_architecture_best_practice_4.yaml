    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, increasing
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks and aligns with best security practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that
      grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each non-compliant bucket, go to the permissions section.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
