    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring a second form of authentication. This is crucial in protecting
      sensitive AWS resources and data.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled under the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled
      for all users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Under the "Security credentials" tab, click
      "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device". 6. Follow the prompts to assign and
      activate an MFA device for the user.
