    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private by
      default to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default reduces the risk of data breaches
      by ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to the public. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
