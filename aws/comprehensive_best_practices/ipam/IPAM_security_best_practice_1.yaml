    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining
      data confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive
      information to the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure all options are enabled. 5. Review the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to confirm there are no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" on the S3 bucket. 2. Review and
      update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions. 3. Adjust
      the ACL to ensure no public permissions are granted.
