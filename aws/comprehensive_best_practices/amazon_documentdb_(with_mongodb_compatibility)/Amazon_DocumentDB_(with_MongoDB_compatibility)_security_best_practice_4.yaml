    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are configured to use Instance Metadata
      Service Version 2 (IMDSv2). IMDSv2 provides additional security features that
      mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to instance metadata.
    Rationale: Using IMDSv2 enhances security by requiring session-oriented requests,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to metadata that could be exploited
      by attackers. Without IMDSv2, attackers might exploit vulnerabilities to access
      sensitive data such as IAM roles and credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and choose each instance to verify.
    - Check the instance metadata options for each instance.
    - Confirm that 'HttpTokens' is set to 'required', indicating that IMDSv2 is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may allow IMDSv1, which does not require
      session tokens.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select the instance needing remediation.
    - Choose 'Actions', then 'Instance Settings', and 'Modify Instance Metadata Options'.
    - Set 'HttpTokens' to 'required' to enforce the use of IMDSv2.
    - Save changes to apply the new setting.
