    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential security
      breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data, reducing the risk of data leakage and ensuring compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy does
        not allow public access.
    - Step 4: Check the "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket and ensure
        they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Step 3: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Step 5: Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent any
        future public access configurations.
