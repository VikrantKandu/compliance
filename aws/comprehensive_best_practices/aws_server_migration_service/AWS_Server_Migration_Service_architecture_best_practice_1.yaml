    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized public access. S3 buckets should have policies
      that restrict access to only authorized users and services.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and potential data loss. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates
      these risks and protects sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket is marked as "Public".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and require explicit policies
      to make them public.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the bucket in the AWS Management
      Console.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy to restrict access only to authorized users.
    - Remove any public access settings or policies that allow public access.
