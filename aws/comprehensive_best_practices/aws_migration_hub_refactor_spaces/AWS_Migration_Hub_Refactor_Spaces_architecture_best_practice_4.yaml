    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets are vulnerable to data theft and
      unauthorized access, which can result in data loss and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Disable 'Block public access' settings if they are not already enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or access control lists that grant public
      access.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
