  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should have policies that restrict public
      access unless explicitly required.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      protect against accidental data exposure.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block public access" settings. 4. Ensure that
      "Block all public access" is enabled. 5. Review bucket policies and access control
      lists (ACLs) to confirm no public access permissions are granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket. 2. Review
      and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly audit S3 bucket settings and policies to ensure compliance.
