    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. This can lead to data breaches,
      loss of intellectual property, and compliance violations.
    Audit: '1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

      2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.

      3. In the S3 dashboard, review the list of buckets.

      4. For each bucket, check the ''Permissions'' tab.

      5. Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant
      public read or write access.

      6. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name>` to review the ACL and `aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>`
      to review the bucket policy.

      '
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: '1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

      2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.

      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.

      4. Go to the ''Permissions'' tab.

      5. Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.

      6. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI commands `aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> --acl private` to set the ACL to private and `aws s3api delete-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>` to remove the bucket policy granting public access.'
