    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can
      protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive information to the internet,
      posing security and compliance risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove public access by updating
      the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the settings.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
