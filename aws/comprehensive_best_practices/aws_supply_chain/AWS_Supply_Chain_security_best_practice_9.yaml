    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information
      and complies with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the "Access" column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and
      verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Edit" under "Block public access (bucket
      settings)".
    - Ensure all options are checked to block public access and save the changes.
