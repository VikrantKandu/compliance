    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized public access to sensitive data stored within
      them.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions settings of each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a public URL accessible from the internet.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but specific actions can make
      them public.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging to track access and changes.
