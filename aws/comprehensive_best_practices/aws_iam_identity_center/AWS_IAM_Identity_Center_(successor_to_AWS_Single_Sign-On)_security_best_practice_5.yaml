    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring a second
      form of authentication in addition to a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
