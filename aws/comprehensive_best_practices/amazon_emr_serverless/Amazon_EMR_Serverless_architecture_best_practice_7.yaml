    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in exposure of sensitive data,
      unauthorized data manipulation, and potential financial and reputational damage.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible is a fundamental security measure
      to protect data in AWS.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' option is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, AWS S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Under 'Block public access', click 'Edit'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the changes.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
