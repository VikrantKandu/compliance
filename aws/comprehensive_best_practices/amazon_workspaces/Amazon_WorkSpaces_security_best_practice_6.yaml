    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of verification
      in addition to their password. This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen, an attacker
      can gain full access to the AWS account. MFA significantly mitigates this risk
      by requiring a second factor that the attacker is unlikely to possess.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security Credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
