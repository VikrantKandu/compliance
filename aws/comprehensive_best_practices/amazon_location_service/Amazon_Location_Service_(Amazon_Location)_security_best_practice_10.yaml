    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to accidental data leaks and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to prevent public access.
