    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are private by
      default reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that there are no public access permissions set.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify that the ACL does not allow public access.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to ensure no bucket policy grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Step 4: Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL and policies.
    - Step 5: Enable block public access settings at both the bucket and account level.
    - Step 6: Review and adjust IAM policies to ensure they do not grant unintended
        public access.
