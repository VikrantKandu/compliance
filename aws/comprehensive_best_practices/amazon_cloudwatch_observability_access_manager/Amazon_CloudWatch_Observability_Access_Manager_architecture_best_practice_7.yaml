    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy'
      to programmatically check the bucket's access policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with access policies.
