    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to ensure
      that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. This involves verifying
      that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify permissions.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access if necessary.
