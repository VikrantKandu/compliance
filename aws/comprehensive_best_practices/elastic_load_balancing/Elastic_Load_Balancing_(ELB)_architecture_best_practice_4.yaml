    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      in the event of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, users are more vulnerable to
      credential theft, which could lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - For each user, check the "MFA device" column to verify that an MFA device is
      assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device."
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
