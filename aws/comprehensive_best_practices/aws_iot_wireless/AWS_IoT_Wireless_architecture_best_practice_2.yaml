    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for the AWS root account to provide an
      additional layer of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate
      forms of verification to access an account, significantly reducing the risk
      of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access, which can lead to data breaches or unauthorized changes to account configurations.
      The root account has unrestricted access to all resources, making it crucial
      to secure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Check the security status section for the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
