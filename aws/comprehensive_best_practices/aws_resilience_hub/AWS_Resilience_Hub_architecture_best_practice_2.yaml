    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible by default
      reduces the risk of accidental exposure of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider enabling "Block Public Access" settings on the bucket to prevent future
      public access configurations.
