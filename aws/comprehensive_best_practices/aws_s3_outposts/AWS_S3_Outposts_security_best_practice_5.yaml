    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts, which can lead to data breaches, data loss, or unauthorized
      usage of AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could allow attackers
      to access and manipulate AWS services and data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        to programmatically check MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled upon creation.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
