  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security by requiring an additional factor
      beyond just a password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      could lead to unauthorized actions within the account.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Review the "MFA" column for
      each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 4. Choose the
      "Security credentials" tab. 5. In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section,
      choose "Assign MFA device". 6. Follow the prompts to complete the MFA setup.
