  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is configured securely
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should be configured to use Instance Metadata Service
      Version 2 (IMDSv2) to enhance security. IMDSv2 adds session-based authentication
      to metadata requests, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Using IMDSv2 prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored
      in the instance metadata by requiring session tokens. This mitigates the risk
      of data exposure from misconfigured applications or SSRF vulnerabilities.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      Metadata options under the Actions menu. 5. Verify that "Metadata version" is
      set to "IMDSv2 only".
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use IMDSv1, which does not require
      session authentication.
  - Remediation: 1. Open the AWS Management Console and go to the EC2 Dashboard. 2.
      Select the instance that needs remediation. 3. Choose Actions, then Instance
      Settings, and then Modify Instance Metadata Options. 4. Set "Metadata version"
      to "IMDSv2 only". 5. Save changes to ensure the instance requires session authentication
      for metadata access.
