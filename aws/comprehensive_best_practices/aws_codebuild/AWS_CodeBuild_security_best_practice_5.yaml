    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      by requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the
      user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have
      immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS services and resources. If a user's password is compromised, the
      second factor of authentication provides an additional barrier to entry.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, go to the 'Security Credentials' tab and click 'Manage' under
      'MFA Device'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate an MFA device for the user.
