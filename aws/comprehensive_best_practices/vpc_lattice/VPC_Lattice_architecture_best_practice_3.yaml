    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACLs and policies.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
