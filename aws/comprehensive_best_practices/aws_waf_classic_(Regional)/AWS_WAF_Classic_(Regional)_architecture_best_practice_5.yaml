  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive
      information.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings for any public grants.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Reassess and modify any IAM policies that may inadvertently allow public access.
