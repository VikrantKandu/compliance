    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      which helps protect sensitive AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, as it requires an additional verification step beyond just a password.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, unauthorized access to AWS
      resources can occur, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized actions
      within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that 'Assigned MFA device' is set for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users, then
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <user_name> for each user to verify MFA
        devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
