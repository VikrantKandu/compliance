    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of data leaks and unauthorized
      data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public read or write permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, with no public access permissions
      set.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access granted in the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
