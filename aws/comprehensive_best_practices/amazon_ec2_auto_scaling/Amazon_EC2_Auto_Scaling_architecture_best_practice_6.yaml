    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public access can lead to data breaches and non-compliance with
      data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access and that the "Block
      all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access. However, existing
      buckets may have different configurations.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you wish to update.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
