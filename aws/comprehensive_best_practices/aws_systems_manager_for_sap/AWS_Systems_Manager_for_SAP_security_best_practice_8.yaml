    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS IAM users to enhance account security by requiring an additional
      authentication factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to AWS accounts by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access in case of compromised passwords.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        --user-name <username> to verify MFA status programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click on 'Manage' and follow the instructions
      to assign an MFA device.
