  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
      to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption automatically encrypts data
      when writing it to storage and decrypts it when accessed.
  - Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data
      leaks and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the "Default encryption" settings under
      the "Properties" tab. 5. Verify that server-side encryption is enabled using
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is not compliant. 4. Go to the "Properties" tab of
      the bucket. 5. Under "Default encryption," choose "Enable" and select either
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS for encryption. 6. Save the changes to apply encryption settings.
