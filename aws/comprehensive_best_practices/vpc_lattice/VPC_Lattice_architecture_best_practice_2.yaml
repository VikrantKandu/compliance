    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in unauthorized access to
      sensitive data, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of accidental data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block Public Access" settings
      are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and ensure they do not allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to enforce bucket access
      restrictions.
