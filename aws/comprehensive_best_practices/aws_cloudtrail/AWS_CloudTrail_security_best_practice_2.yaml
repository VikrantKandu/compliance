  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS accounts to enhance security. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring a second form of authentication, typically a one-time passcode,
      in addition to a password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access, even
      if the account password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to phishing attacks and brute force attempts, which can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity
      and Access Management) dashboard. 3. In the left pane, select 'Users'. 4. For
      each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' and 'aws iam list-mfa-devices'
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for AWS accounts.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 4. Click
      on the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. In the 'Assigned MFA device' section,
      click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device. 6. Ensure that
      all users have MFA devices assigned to enhance account security.
