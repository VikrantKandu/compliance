    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: By restricting public access to S3 buckets, organizations can prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to data leaks, intellectual
      property theft, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public
      access settings enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings and ensure no public grants.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket permissions.
    - Update bucket policies to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
