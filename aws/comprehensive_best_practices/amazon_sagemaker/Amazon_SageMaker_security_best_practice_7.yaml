    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private
      by default helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for each S3 bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket settings for compliance.
