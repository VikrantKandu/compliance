  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to unauthorized
      access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Block public access' settings. 4. Ensure that
      all public access is blocked. 5. Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not
      grant public read or write permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Click on 'Block public
      access' and enable all options to block public access to the bucket. 5. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
