  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with default security groups.
      Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which can pose
      a security risk. It is a best practice to create custom security groups with
      specific rules tailored to the application's requirements.
  - Rationale: Using default security groups can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks as they allow unrestricted access. Custom security groups provide better
      control over the traffic allowed to and from instances, reducing the attack
      surface.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instances are using the default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified at launch.
  - Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Update the EC2 instance to use the newly created custom security group.
    - Remove the instance from the default security group to ensure compliance.
