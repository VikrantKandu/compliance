    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      access to only authorized users reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy that allows public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the access control list for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access using the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and access control list to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
    - Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access
      to the bucket.
