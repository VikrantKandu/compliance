    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. Enabling MFA adds an
      extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If a user's password is compromised, MFA provides an additional
      barrier, preventing unauthorized access. Failure to enable MFA increases the
      risk of account compromise and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and choose the "Security credentials"
      tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", choose "Manage" and follow the steps to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device.
