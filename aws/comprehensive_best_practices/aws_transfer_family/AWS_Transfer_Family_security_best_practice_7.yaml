    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious users to access, modify, or delete data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, data loss,
      and unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data compromise and aligns with data privacy requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket settings to
      enable 'Block all public access.'
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Config rules or Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to
      enforce this configuration across all buckets.
