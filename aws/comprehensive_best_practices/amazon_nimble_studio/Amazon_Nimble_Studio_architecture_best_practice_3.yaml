  - ID: AWS-IAM-001
  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile app.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect the AWS account from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if credentials are compromised, an attacker could gain
      access to AWS resources and data.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA' column for each
      user to ensure that it shows 'Enabled'.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select a user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7.
      Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device.
