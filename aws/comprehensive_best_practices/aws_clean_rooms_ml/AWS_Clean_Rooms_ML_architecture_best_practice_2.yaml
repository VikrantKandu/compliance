    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      public helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each
        bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Step 5: Verify that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for all existing S3 buckets.
    - Action 2: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow
        public access.
    - Action 3: Regularly audit bucket permissions and access settings to maintain
        compliance.
