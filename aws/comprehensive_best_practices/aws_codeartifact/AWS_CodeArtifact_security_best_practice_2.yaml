    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a physical device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials by adding an extra step
      in the authentication process, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS
      resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - Select each user and check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that 'Assigned MFA device' is present for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on 'Users' and select the user to whom you want to assign an MFA device.
    - Open the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to assign an MFA device.
