    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional
      layer of security beyond just a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA, an
      attacker with stolen credentials could gain unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA device" column to verify an MFA device is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - Click on each user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab and select "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
