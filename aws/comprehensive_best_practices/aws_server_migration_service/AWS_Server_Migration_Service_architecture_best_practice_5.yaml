    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps
      maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> and aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      policies and ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Implement bucket policies and ACLs that restrict access to only authorized users
      or services.
