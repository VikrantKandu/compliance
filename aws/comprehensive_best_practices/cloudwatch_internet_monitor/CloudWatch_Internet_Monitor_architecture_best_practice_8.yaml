    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an additional layer of protection on top of a username and password,
      requiring users to provide a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks
      such as password theft or phishing, potentially leading to data breaches and
      unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify MFA status for each
      user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow the
      prompts to assign a virtual MFA device and complete the setup process.
