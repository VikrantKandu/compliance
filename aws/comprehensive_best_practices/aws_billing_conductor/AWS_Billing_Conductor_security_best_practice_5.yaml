  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check to ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of accidental
      data leakage.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs
      grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab and
      enable "Block all public access." 5. Review and modify any bucket policies or
      ACLs that allow public access to ensure they are restricted.
