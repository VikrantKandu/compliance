  - ID: AWS-IAM-001
  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to
      AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to potential
      security breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically verify MFA
      status for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select a user and choose
      the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'
      and follow the steps to enable MFA for the user.
