    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security
      to the login process by requiring a second form of identification. This best
      practice is crucial for protecting AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps mitigate the risk of compromised credentials by
      requiring a second factor during authentication. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to attacks such as phishing and credential stuffing.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to confirm that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" in the Multi-Factor Authentication section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and enable MFA for the user.
