    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policies and ACLs for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has a policy or ACL granting public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure the bucket cannot be made
      public.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket policies and permissions to maintain compliance.
