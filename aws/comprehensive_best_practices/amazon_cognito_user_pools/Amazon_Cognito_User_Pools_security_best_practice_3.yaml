    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data leaks,
      legal implications, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) for public permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically check the bucket's public access
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy.
    - Adjust the Access Control List (ACL) to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to override any public permissions.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
