    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public access can
      lead to exposure of confidential information and violate compliance requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has 'Public' access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies and ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings on the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies and permissions to prevent unintentional
      public access.
