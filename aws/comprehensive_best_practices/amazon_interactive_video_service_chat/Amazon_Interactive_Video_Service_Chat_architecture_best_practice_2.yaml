    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      and services, making it a high-value target for attackers. Without MFA, the
      account is vulnerable to compromised passwords.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" and then "Security credentials" for the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is listed as "Enabled."
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" and then "Security credentials" for the root account.
    - Follow the steps to activate MFA by choosing a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
    - Complete the setup process by scanning the QR code or entering the secret key
      into your MFA device and entering the generated code.
