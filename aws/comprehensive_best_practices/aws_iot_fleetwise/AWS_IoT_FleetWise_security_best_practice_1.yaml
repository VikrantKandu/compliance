  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials,
      as it requires an additional factor beyond just a username and password. Without
      MFA, unauthorized access to AWS resources can occur if credentials are compromised.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list users with MFA enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
