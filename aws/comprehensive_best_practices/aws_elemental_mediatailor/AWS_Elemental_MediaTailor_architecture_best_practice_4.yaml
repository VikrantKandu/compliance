    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of identification, in addition to their password, to access the
      account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the AWS root account helps protect the account from
      unauthorized access. If the root account is compromised, it could lead to severe
      security breaches, including data loss, service disruption, and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the 'Users' section and click on the root account.
    - Check if MFA is enabled on the root account by reviewing the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', select 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to set up and enable MFA using a virtual or hardware MFA
      device.
