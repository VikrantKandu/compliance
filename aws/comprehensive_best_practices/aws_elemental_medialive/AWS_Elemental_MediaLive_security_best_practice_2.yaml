  - Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored within them. This
      can lead to unauthorized data access, data leaks, and potential exploitation
      by malicious actors. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default helps protect
      sensitive information and maintains compliance with security standards.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant
      public access. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check the ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy to restrict public access. 2. Remove any public read or write permissions
      from the bucket ACL. 3. Use the "Block Public Access" settings in the S3 console
      to prevent future public access configurations. 4. Regularly review bucket permissions
      and policies to ensure compliance with security best practices.
