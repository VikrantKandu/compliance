  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Securely Configured
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are securely configured to prevent
      unauthorized access and data leaks. This includes setting appropriate bucket
      policies, enabling encryption, and ensuring logging is enabled.
  - Rationale: Securely configured S3 buckets help protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data exposure,
      compliance violations, and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket policies and permissions to ensure they
      are not publicly accessible unless explicitly required. 4. Verify that server-side
      encryption is enabled for each bucket. 5. Check that logging is enabled for
      each bucket to track access and changes.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Update bucket policies to restrict access to only necessary users
      and services. 2. Enable server-side encryption for each bucket. 3. Enable logging
      for each bucket to monitor access and changes.
