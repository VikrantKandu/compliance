    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leakage. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive
      information and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm there are no
      public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Utilize S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
