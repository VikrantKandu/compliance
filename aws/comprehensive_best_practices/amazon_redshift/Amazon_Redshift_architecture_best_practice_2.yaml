    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This security check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds
      an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password, reducing the
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended because it significantly
      enhances account security by requiring an additional authentication factor.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially
      if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to IAM and select Users.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security credentials tab and select Manage MFA.
    - Follow the steps to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
