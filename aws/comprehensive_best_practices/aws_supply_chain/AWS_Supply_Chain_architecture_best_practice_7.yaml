    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, which can lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets. 4. For each bucket, check the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled. 6. If public access
      is required, ensure that specific permissions are reviewed and documented.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Click on "Edit" under "Block public access". 6. Enable "Block all public
      access" and save changes. 7. If public access is necessary, configure bucket
      policies and ACLs to limit access to only trusted entities.
