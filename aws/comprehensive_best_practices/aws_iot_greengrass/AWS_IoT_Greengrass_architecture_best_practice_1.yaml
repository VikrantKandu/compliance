  - Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users with console access
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environments by requiring a second form of authentication. Enabling
      MFA for IAM users with console access helps prevent unauthorized access to your
      AWS resources.
  - Rationale: Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources, resulting in potential data breaches or resource misuse. MFA
      significantly reduces the risk of credential compromise by requiring a second
      factor for authentication.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Select Users from the navigation pane. 4. For each user with console access,
      check if MFA is enabled by verifying the "MFA" column. 5. Ensure all users with
      console access have MFA enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to use MFA.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. Select Users from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. In the user's details, select the "Security credentials"
      tab. 6. Click on "Manage MFA" and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
