    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not launched using the
      default security group. Default security groups allow all inbound traffic from
      other instances in the same group, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      instances to unnecessary network traffic, increasing the risk of unauthorized
      access or data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with the default security
      group.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with the necessary rules.
    - Detach the default security group and attach the newly created security group
      to the instance.
