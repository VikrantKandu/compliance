    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users. Instead, policies should be attached to groups or roles to
      promote role-based access control and manage permissions more efficiently.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to permission sprawl
      and makes it difficult to manage user permissions effectively. By attaching
      policies to groups or roles, it becomes easier to manage and audit permissions,
      reducing the risk of excessive permissions and potential security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each user to ensure that no policies are directly attached.
    - Verify that policies are assigned to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, AWS allows policies to be attached directly to users.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies directly attached to users.
    - Create or use existing groups or roles to attach the necessary policies.
    - Add users to appropriate groups or assign roles to ensure they have the required
      permissions.
