  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read or write access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data exposure.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions. 4. Check for any bucket
      policies or ACLs that allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify bucket
      policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
      2. Use the AWS Management Console to apply a bucket policy that denies public
      access. 3. Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access.
      4. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent any future
      public access configurations.
