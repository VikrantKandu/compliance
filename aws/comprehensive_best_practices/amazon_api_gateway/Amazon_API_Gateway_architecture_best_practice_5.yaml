    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial as it prevents unauthorized
      users from accessing sensitive data, which can lead to data leaks and security
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) granting
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
