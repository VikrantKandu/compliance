    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to
      provide two or more verification factors to gain access, making it harder for
      unauthorized individuals to access accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of protection to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible
      to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA
      devices for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user and go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
    - Ensure users are informed and trained on how to use MFA devices.
