    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to enhance security by providing an isolated network environment.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides network isolation and
      additional security controls such as security groups and network ACLs. Instances
      outside a VPC may be exposed to public networks, increasing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Verify that all instances are listed under a VPC ID.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and ensure
      each instance has a non-null VpcId.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched within the default VPC in
      each region.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not within a VPC.
    - Stop the instance if necessary and create an AMI.
    - Launch a new instance from the AMI within a VPC.
    - Terminate the original instance outside the VPC.
