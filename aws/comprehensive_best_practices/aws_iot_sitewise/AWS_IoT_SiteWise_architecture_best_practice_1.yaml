    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default
      to prevent unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL settings do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, modify the bucket ACL and policy to restrict
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to update the bucket settings.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Consider enabling AWS S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or specific
      buckets.
