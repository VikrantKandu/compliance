  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors leading to potential data loss or disclosure.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings. 4. Verify that
      all public access settings are enabled to block public access. 5. Confirm that
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block
      Public Access'. 4. Enable all options to block public access. 5. Review bucket
      policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access. 6. Save the changes
      to apply the new settings.
