    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of
      data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access permissions
      set.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for any public grants.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by checking the Block
      Public Access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket permissions
      to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to update the bucket policy and access
      control list (ACL) to restrict access.
    - Enable the Block Public Access feature for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
