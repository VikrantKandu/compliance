    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and unauthorized access. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions of each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      specific users or roles.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
