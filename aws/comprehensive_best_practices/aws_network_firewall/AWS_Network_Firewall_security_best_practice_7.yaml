    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Misconfigured S3 buckets
      have led to significant data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that public access
        is blocked.
    - Step 5: Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 3: Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Step 4: Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Step 5: Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access
        permissions.
