    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to sensitive
      data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Restricting public access helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions to ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Check for any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket's ACLs
      and policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the ACL to private.
