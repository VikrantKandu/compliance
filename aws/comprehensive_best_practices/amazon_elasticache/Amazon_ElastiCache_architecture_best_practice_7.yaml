    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as they can expose
      sensitive data to the public internet. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for any buckets
      marked as "Public". 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view the
      settings. 5. Under "Permissions", verify that the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) do not allow public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically check the ACL for
      public access. 7. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the
      bucket in the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the "Permissions" tab and review
      the bucket policy and ACL. 3. Remove any statements in the bucket policy that
      grant public access. 4. Adjust the ACL to ensure that only authorized users
      have access. 5. Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future
      public access configurations.
