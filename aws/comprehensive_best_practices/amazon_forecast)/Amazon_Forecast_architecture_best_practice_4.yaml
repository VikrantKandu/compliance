    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: The IAM password policy should be enabled to enforce strong password
      requirements for AWS users. This helps in ensuring that all user accounts are
      protected by passwords that meet a minimum level of complexity and length, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling a strong IAM password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      user accounts by enforcing password complexity, expiration, and reuse requirements.
      This is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to AWS resources and maintaining
      overall account security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the account settings for the password policy.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets your organization's security
      requirements.
    Default Value: By default, the IAM password policy may not be enabled or may not
      enforce strong password requirements.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Go to Account Settings and select Password Policy.
    - Enable the password policy and configure it to enforce password complexity,
      length, expiration, and reuse prevention according to your security requirements.
