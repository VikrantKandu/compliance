    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to present two or more separate forms
      of identification before they can access resources. This helps protect against
      unauthorized access in case credentials are compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      by adding an additional layer of security. If MFA is not enabled, compromised
      credentials can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential data
      loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Ensure that each user has 'MFA enabled' listed in the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      get-user for each user to check the MFADevice attribute.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
