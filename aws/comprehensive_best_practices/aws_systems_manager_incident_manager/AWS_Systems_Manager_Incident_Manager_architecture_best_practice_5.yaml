    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security.
      MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a
      second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains
      a user's password can gain full access to the user's permissions and potentially
      compromise the entire AWS environment.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users and check for attached MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the
      instructions to enable a virtual or hardware MFA device for the user.
