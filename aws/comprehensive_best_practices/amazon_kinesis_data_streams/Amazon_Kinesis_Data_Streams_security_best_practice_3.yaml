  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access sensitive data, leading to data loss and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions. 4. Ensure that the
      bucket policy does not grant public access. 5. Verify that the "Block Public
      Access" settings are enabled for the account and specific buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
      2. For each bucket, review the permissions and bucket policy. 3. Remove any
      statements granting public access. 4. Enable "Block Public Access" settings
      for the account and individual buckets to prevent future public access configurations.
