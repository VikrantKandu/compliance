    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      access to only authorized users mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify that
      there are no public access permissions set on the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
