    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to unauthorized users. This can lead to data breaches, loss of intellectual
      property, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket and ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not grant public access.
    - Check bucket policies using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Enable block public access settings on the bucket to prevent future public access
      configurations.
