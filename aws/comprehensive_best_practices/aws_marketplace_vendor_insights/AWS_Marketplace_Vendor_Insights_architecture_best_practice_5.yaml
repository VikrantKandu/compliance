    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users and can lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Public access can lead to data leaks, unauthorized data manipulation,
      and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' option.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      they are compliant with the best practice.
