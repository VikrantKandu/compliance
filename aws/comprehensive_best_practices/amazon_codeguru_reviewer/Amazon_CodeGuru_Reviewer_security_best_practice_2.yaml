    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are not associated with
      the default security group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound
      traffic, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to potential
      security threats as it allows unrestricted inbound traffic. This can lead to
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security Groups' associated with it.
    - Verify that none of the instances are associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that
      adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    - Associate the custom security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Remove the association of the default security group from the instances.
