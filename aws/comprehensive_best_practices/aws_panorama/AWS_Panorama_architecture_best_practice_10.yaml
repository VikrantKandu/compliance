    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a unique authentication code from
      a hardware or virtual MFA device in addition to their username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, as it requires an additional factor for authentication. Without
      MFA, an attacker with stolen credentials could gain unauthorized access to AWS
      resources.
    Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all IAM users and check
      if MFA is enabled. Specifically, use the command 'aws iam list-users' followed
      by 'aws iam list-mfa-devices' for each user to verify MFA device association.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: To remediate, enable MFA for each IAM user by going to the AWS Management
      Console, selecting IAM, choosing Users, and then selecting the appropriate user.
      Under the Security Credentials tab, assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
