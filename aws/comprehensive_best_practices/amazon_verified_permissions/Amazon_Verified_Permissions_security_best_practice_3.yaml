    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of accidental exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to review bucket ACLs and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any bucket that is publicly accessible, go to the permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
