    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private protects against unauthorized access and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings. Ensure that 'Block all public access'
      is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access is allowed.
