    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail should be enabled in all AWS regions to ensure that all
      API activity is logged and monitored. This helps in maintaining a comprehensive
      audit trail of all account activity.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail is crucial for security and compliance as it provides
      visibility into user activity, helping to detect unauthorized actions. Without
      it, there is a risk of undetected malicious activity and non-compliance with
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that there is a trail configured and enabled in all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is logging management events and data events.
    Default Value: By default, CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to ensure it is enabled in all
      regions.
    - Ensure the trail is configured to log both management and data events.
    - Save the changes and verify that the trail is active.
