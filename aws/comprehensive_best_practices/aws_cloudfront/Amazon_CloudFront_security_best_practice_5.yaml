  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring that buckets are not public, organizations
      can protect their data from exposure to the internet.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible. 4. Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow
      public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access. 2.
      Use S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access to the bucket.
      3. Regularly review and monitor bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
