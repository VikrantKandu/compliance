    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. It is crucial to ensure that S3 bucket permissions
      are configured to restrict public access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACLs do not grant public read or write permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured to be so.
    Remediation:
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or individual buckets
      to prevent future public access configurations.
