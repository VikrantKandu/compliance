    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of
      sensitive information being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public
      access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      verify the bucket's ACL.
    - Check the bucket policy for statements that allow public access using the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable bucket settings to block all public access if applicable.
