    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Public Access Blocked
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have their public access blocked
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Blocking public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to significant
      security incidents if sensitive data is inadvertently exposed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block all public access" settings.
    - Verify that all options under "Block public access settings for this bucket"
      are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked, but existing
      buckets may not.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Click "Edit" under "Block public access (bucket settings)".
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Save changes.
