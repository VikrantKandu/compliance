    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of user credentials. MFA adds an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      which significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended to protect against unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to phishing
      attacks and other security breaches. MFA provides an extra layer of security
      beyond just a username and password.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure it is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on each user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA for the user.
