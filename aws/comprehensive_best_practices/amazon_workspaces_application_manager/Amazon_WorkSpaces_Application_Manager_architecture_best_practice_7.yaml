    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      and do not allow public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
      Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket access settings do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      check for any public grants.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Remove any public access grants using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
    - Enable bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) to enforce private access.
