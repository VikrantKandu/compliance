    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Have Termination Protection Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that termination protection is enabled for EC2
      instances to prevent accidental termination. Termination protection is a feature
      that helps safeguard instances from being inadvertently terminated, which can
      lead to data loss and service disruption.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection reduces the risk of accidental data
      loss and service downtime by preventing unintended instance termination. It
      is particularly important for critical instances that host essential applications
      or data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check if termination protection is enabled by selecting the
      instance and viewing its details.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id
      <instance-id> --attribute disableApiTermination and verify if "DisableApiTermination"
      is set to true.
    Default Value: Termination protection is disabled by default for EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Select the instance you wish to protect.
    - Choose Actions, then Instance Settings, and select Change Termination Protection.
    - Enable termination protection and save the changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id
      <instance-id> --no-disable-api-termination to enable termination protection.
