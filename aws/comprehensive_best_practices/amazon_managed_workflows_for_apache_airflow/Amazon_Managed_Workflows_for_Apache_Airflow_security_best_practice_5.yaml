    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that allow public access can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps maintain data privacy
      and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
