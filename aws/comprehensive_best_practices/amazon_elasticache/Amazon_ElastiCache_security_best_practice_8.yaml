  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and reduces the risk of data breaches. Publicly
      accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access, modify, or
      delete data.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for the account and each
      bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Verify the Access Control List (ACL) does not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the account and each bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Update the Access Control List (ACL) to remove any public access permissions.
