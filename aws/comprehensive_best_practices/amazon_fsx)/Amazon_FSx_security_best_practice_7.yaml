    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data leaks or unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure neither allows
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy.
    - Set the ACL to private or remove any public grants.
    - Use the AWS CLI or Management Console to apply these changes.
