    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Bucket Policies
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets have bucket policies configured
      to manage access permissions effectively. Bucket policies can restrict access
      to specific users, define permissions, and enforce security requirements.
    Rationale: Without proper bucket policies, S3 buckets may be exposed to unauthorized
      access, leading to data breaches or data loss. Configuring bucket policies helps
      control access and enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check if a bucket policy is attached under the Bucket Policy section.
    - Verify that the policy aligns with your security requirements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have bucket policies configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and click on Edit under the Bucket Policy section.
    - Define a bucket policy that meets your security requirements.
    - Save the changes to apply the policy to the bucket.
