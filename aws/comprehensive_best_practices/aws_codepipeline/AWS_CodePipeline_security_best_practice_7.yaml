    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches or leaks. By ensuring buckets are private, you
      mitigate the risk of data exposure and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Ensure IAM policies do not grant public access to the bucket.
