    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Confirm that the 'Block Public Access' setting is enabled for all buckets.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' on all S3 buckets.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically enforce bucket policies that
      restrict public access.
