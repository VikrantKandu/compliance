  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two
      or more verification factors to gain access, significantly reducing the risk
      of compromised credentials.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that protects
      against unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised passwords can lead to
      unauthorized actions and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA' column for each
      user to ensure MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws
      iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify MFA status for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In
      the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
      7. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
