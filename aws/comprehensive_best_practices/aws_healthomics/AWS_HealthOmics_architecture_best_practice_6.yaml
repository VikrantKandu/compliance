    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps protect your data
      by encrypting it before storing it and decrypting it when accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets
      may be vulnerable to unauthorized access and disclosure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to configure.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," select "Enable" and choose the desired encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes.
