    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to provide
      an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to access
      sensitive resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of user accounts by requiring additional
      authentication beyond just a password. Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access through compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'Security Credentials'
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section.
    - Follow the prompts to activate MFA for the user using a virtual or hardware
      MFA device.
