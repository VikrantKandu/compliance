    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are built from a secure
      and vetted baseline, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance
      with organizational policies.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: List all running EC2 instances and note their AMI IDs.
    - Step 4: Compare the AMI IDs against the list of approved AMIs maintained by
        your organization.
    - Step 5: Verify that all instances are using AMIs from the approved list.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any AMI available
      in the account or AWS Marketplace.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Action 2: Plan and execute the replacement of non-compliant instances with new
        instances using approved AMIs.
    - Action 3: Update organizational policies and processes to restrict the use of
        non-approved AMIs in the future.
