    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for AWS accounts by requiring not only a password but also a second form of
      verification. This helps protect accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users mitigates the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, an attacker with a user's password could gain full access to the
      account, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. Check each user to verify that
      MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM dashboard. 2.
      Choose "Users" from the navigation pane. 3. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 4. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Under the "Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Manage". 6. Follow the on-screen instructions
      to enable MFA for the user.
