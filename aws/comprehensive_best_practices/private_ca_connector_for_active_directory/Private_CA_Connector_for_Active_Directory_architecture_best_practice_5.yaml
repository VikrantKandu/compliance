    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access can lead to
      sensitive data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and violations of compliance requirements.
      Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks by restricting access to
      authorized users only.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Review and update IAM policies to ensure they do not inadvertently allow public
      access.
