    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not have public access permissions,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps prevent accidental
      or malicious exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
