    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets could lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the "Public access settings" to ensure that public
        access is blocked.
    - Step 4: Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they
        do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to block public access settings
        for the bucket.
    - Action 2: Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not
        grant public access.
    - Action 3: Use AWS Trusted Advisor or AWS Config to continuously monitor and
        alert for publicly accessible S3 buckets.
