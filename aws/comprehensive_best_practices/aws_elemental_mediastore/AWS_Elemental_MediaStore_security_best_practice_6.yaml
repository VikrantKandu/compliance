    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive data and comply
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
