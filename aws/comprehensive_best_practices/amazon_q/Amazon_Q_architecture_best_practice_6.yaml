    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict access to authorized users only.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being
      exposed to the internet, resulting in data leaks and potential regulatory compliance
      violations. Restricting access to authenticated users mitigates this risk.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that the 'Block all
      public access' option is enabled. 5. Verify that the bucket policy does not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that needs to be secured. 3. Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block
      all public access'. 4. Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does
      not grant public access. 5. Save changes and verify that the bucket is no longer
      publicly accessible.
