  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Launched in a VPC
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and security. VPCs provide advanced security
      features such as security groups and network ACLs that help protect instances
      from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in a VPC enhances security by providing isolation
      from other AWS customers. It allows for more granular control over network traffic,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Instances not launched in a VPC lack
      these security benefits and are more vulnerable to attacks.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane. 4. Verify that each instance
      is associated with a VPC by checking the 'VPC ID' column.
  - Default Value: By default, instances are launched in the default VPC if no specific
      VPC is specified.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances that are not in a VPC. 2. Stop the instances
      that need to be moved to a VPC. 3. Create or select an existing VPC. 4. Launch
      new instances within the VPC. 5. Migrate data and configurations to the new
      instances. 6. Terminate the old instances that were not in a VPC.
