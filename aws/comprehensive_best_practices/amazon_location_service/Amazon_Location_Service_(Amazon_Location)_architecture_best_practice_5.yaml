    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Restricting access to authorized users
      only is crucial for data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      public access.
