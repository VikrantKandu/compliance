    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access permissions.
    - Verify that no buckets are publicly accessible by checking the bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
