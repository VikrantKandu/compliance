    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by requiring
      a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to
      compromise, especially if passwords are weak or reused.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled in the Security credentials tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the Security credentials tab, click on Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
