    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Default Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling default encryption ensures that all
      new objects stored in the bucket are automatically encrypted, providing an additional
      layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling default encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. If encryption is
      not enabled, data stored in S3 buckets may be vulnerable to exposure, leading
      to compliance violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled and configured with an appropriate
      encryption option (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have default encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have default encryption enabled.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," select "Enable" and choose the desired encryption
      option.
    - Save changes to apply default encryption to the bucket.
