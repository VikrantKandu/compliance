    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and
      potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to unauthorized users. This can result in data leaks, compliance violations,
      and financial losses. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check ACL permissions.
    - Use the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Implement a bucket policy that denies public access or use the Block Public
      Access settings to restrict access.
    - Verify the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
