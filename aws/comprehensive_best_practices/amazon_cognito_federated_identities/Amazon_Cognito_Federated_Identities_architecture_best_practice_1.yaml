  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks, unauthorized access, and non-compliance with
      data protection regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm there are
      no public permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to remove
      any public access permissions.
    - Regularly monitor and audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
