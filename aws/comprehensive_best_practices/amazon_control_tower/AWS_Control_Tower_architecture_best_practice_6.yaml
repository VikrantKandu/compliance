    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by attackers to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure public access is restricted.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to enable 'Block Public Access' for the bucket.
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
