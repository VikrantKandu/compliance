    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public access
      settings.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Click on 'Edit' under 'Block public access' and enable all options.
    - Review and remove any public access settings in the bucket policy and ACL.
