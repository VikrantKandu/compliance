    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are private protects sensitive
      information and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Verify that no bucket has a policy allowing public access.
    - Step 5: Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' to check the ACL settings
        for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Edit the bucket permissions to remove public access.
    - Step 5: Update the bucket policy to restrict access only to authorized users
        or roles.
    - Step 6: Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api put-bucket-policy' to apply the updated
        policy.
