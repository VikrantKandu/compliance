    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password, requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials and prevents unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker could gain full access to the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA device' is listed as active. If not, the user does
      not have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the steps to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
