    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents, which can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by
      default protects sensitive information and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as Public.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to check bucket permissions.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any publicly accessible bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the Permissions
      tab.
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket policy or ACL.
    - Consider enabling Block Public Access settings for the bucket or account-wide.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-policy to update the bucket policy
      to restrict public access.
