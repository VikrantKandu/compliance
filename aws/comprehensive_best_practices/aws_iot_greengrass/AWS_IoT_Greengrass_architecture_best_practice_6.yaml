    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to
      AWS resources if credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA device' is enabled under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage' under the 'MFA device'
      section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
