    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance types
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest generation
      instance types to benefit from improved performance, security, and cost efficiency.
    Rationale: Using the latest generation instance types provides better performance,
      enhanced security features, and can be more cost-effective. Older instance types
      may lack support for newer AWS features and optimizations, leading to potential
      security vulnerabilities and higher operational costs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Check the instance type for each instance.
    - Verify that the instance type is from the latest generation of EC2 instances.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may be launched with any available instance type,
      including older generations.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances running on older generation instance types.
    - Plan for a migration to newer instance types, considering compatibility and
      performance requirements.
    - Update the instance type by stopping the instance, changing the instance type,
      and restarting the instance.
