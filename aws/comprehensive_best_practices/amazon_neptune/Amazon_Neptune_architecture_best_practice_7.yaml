    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings to verify that
      they do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS Trusted Advisor or AWS Config rules to identify publicly accessible
      buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to disable public access settings for the bucket.
    - Implement VPC endpoints or IAM policies to restrict access to the bucket.
