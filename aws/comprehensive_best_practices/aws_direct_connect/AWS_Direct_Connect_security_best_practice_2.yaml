    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to enhance security and network management.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides enhanced security by
      isolating them from external networks and allowing for more granular control
      over inbound and outbound traffic. Without a VPC, instances are more exposed
      to potential security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Verify that all listed instances have a VPC ID associated with them.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      for the presence of a VPC ID in the output for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched within the default VPC of
      the region.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Identify instances not within a VPC.
    - Terminate and re-launch the instances within a VPC, ensuring to select the appropriate
      VPC during configuration.
    - Alternatively, create a new VPC and migrate the instances by creating AMIs and
      launching them in the new VPC.
