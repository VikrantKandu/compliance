    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to anyone
      on the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      verify ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
