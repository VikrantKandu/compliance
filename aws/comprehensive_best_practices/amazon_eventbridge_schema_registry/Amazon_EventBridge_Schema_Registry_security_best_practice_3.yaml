    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be enabled for all AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond just a password.
      Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA Device' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with
        MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab and choose 'Manage' next to 'Assigned
      MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
