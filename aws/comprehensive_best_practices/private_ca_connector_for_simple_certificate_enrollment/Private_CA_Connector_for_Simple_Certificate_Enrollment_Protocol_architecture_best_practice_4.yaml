    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials by requiring a second factor
      of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources
      if a user's password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' and then 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign MFA to the user.
