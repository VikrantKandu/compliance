    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials from being
      compromised. Without MFA, a malicious actor who gains access to a user's password
      could potentially access sensitive AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on 'Users' to list all IAM users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and check for MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and click on 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to configure a virtual or hardware MFA device.
