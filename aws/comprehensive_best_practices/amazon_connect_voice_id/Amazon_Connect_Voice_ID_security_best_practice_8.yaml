    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unintended data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Restricting public access reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket permissions to remove public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
