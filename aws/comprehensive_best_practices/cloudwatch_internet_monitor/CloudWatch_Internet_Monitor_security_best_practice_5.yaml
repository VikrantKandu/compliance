    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are encrypted at rest
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This best practice ensures that all AWS CloudFormation stacks utilize
      encryption for data at rest to protect sensitive information.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored in CloudFormation
      stacks could be exposed to malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Step 3: Select a stack and check the encryption settings for resources like
        S3 buckets, RDS instances, etc.
    - Step 4: Verify that encryption is enabled for all applicable resources within
        the stack.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation resources may not have encryption enabled
      unless specified during stack creation.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify the resources within the CloudFormation stack that require
        encryption.
    - Step 2: Modify the CloudFormation template to include encryption settings for
        these resources.
    - Step 3: Update the stack with the modified template to apply encryption.
    - Step 4: Validate that encryption is now enabled for all applicable resources.
