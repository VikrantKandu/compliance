    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) to enhance account security by enforcing password
      complexity and expiration policies.
    Rationale: A strong password policy helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without a robust password policy, there is an increased risk of compromised
      accounts due to weak or reused passwords.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the IAM Dashboard, check the Password Policy section. 4. Verify that the
      password policy is enabled and complies with organizational security requirements,
      such as minimum password length, requiring numbers, symbols, uppercase, and
      lowercase letters, password expiration, and preventing password reuse.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the IAM Dashboard, locate the Password Policy section. 4. Click
      on 'Set password policy' and configure the policy with the necessary complexity
      and expiration settings. 5. Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
