    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible,
      organizations can protect their data from unintended exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review its permissions.
    - Check the "Block all public access" settings under the bucket's permissions
      tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
