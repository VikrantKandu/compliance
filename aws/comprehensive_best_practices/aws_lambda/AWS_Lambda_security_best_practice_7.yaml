    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption automatically encrypts
      data when it is written to S3 and decrypts it when accessed by an authorized
      user.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
      Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) and save
      the changes.
