    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to provide more than one form of verification to access AWS resources, thereby
      reducing the risk of compromised accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances the security of AWS
      accounts by requiring an additional verification step. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized usage of AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the
      user.
