    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS accounts. By requiring a second form of authentication, it
      reduces the risk of unauthorized account access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access, especially
      if a user's password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks such as phishing or brute force attempts.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
