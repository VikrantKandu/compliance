    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps in maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
      Steps: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
        service. 3. Select 'Buckets' to list all S3 buckets in the account. 4. For
        each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab. 5. Verify that 'Block all public
        access' is enabled. 6. Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public
        access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not grant public access.
    Remediation:
      Steps: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
        service. 3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
        tab. 5. Click on 'Block public access (bucket settings)' and enable 'Block
        all public access'. 6. Review the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do
        not grant public access. 7. Save the changes and recheck the bucket permissions
        to confirm compliance.
