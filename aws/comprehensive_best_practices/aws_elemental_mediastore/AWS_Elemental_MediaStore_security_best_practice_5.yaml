    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible Only When Necessary
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required for business purposes. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Limiting public access reduces the risk of
      data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) settings to identify publicly
      accessible buckets.
    - Verify whether the public access settings are necessary for business requirements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible and does not require public access, modify
      the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust IAM policies to ensure they do not grant unnecessary public
      access.
