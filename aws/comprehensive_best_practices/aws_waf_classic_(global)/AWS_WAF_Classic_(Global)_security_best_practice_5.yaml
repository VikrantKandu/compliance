    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encrypting data at rest helps to prevent unauthorized
      access and protects sensitive information.
    Rationale: Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and data breaches. Encrypting data at rest ensures that even if data
      is accessed without authorization, it cannot be read without the appropriate
      decryption keys.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Check if 'Default encryption' is enabled under the 'Bucket settings for Default
      encryption' section.
    - Repeat for all buckets in the account.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled
      unless specified during creation or configured later.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Bucket settings for Default encryption', choose 'Edit'.
    - Select 'Enable' and choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to enforce encryption on the bucket.
