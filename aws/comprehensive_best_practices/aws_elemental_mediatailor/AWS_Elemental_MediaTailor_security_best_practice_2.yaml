    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket ACL for public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have "Block all public access" enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and remove any public bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
