    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using only
      approved Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency in security and
      compliance across the environment.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and inconsistencies
      in security configurations, leading to potential security breaches and non-compliance
      with organizational policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running instances and their associated AMIs.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches the organization's list of approved AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      for launching EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Terminate or re-launch these instances using approved AMIs.
    - Update organizational policies to enforce the use of approved AMIs through IAM
      policies or AWS Service Catalog.
