    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not use default security groups as they are
      often configured with overly permissive rules, which can expose the instance
      to unnecessary risks.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to potential security risks
      as they typically allow unrestricted access. Ensuring instances are associated
      with specific security groups helps in applying principle of least privilege.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Ensure that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the instances using default security groups.
    - Create a new security group with specific rules tailored to the instance's requirements.
    - Detach the default security group and attach the newly created security group
      to the instance.
