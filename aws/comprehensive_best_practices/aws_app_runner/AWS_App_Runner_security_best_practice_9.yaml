    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password
      and username but also something that only the user has access to, i.e., a physical
      token or a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect user credentials and reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible
      to being compromised, especially if passwords are weak or reused.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Check each user to ensure that
      MFA is enabled by verifying that the "MFA device" column is populated.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. Under "Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)", choose "Manage". 7. Follow the on-screen instructions
      to assign an MFA device.
