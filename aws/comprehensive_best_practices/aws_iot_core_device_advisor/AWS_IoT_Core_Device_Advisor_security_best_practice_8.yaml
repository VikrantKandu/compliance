    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      more than one piece of evidence to authenticate their identity.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by preventing unauthorized
      access, even if user credentials are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are
      vulnerable to attacks such as phishing or brute force.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by selecting the user and reviewing the
      'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, choose 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
