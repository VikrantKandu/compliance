    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of identification,
      such as a temporary code from a mobile app, in addition to their password. This
      practice helps protect against unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, as an attacker would need access to the second factor in addition
      to the password. Without MFA, there is a higher risk of unauthorized access,
      which could lead to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA Device' column
      to ensure that MFA is enabled for each user. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-users and check the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Click on the username
      for which you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
      6. In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
      7. Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for
      the user.
