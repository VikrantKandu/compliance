    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they
      are not set to allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to run the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify the ACL settings.
    - Check for any bucket policies that allow public access using the command aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
