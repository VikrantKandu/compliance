    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket.
    - Check the bucket permissions to ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) granting
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
