    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions tab. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      does not have public access enabled. Check the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) for public permissions. 5. Verify that the bucket is not listed in
      the "Public" section of the S3 console.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured to be public.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the permissions tab and remove
      any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACL. 4. Enable the "Block
      Public Access" settings for the bucket. 5. Review and update any IAM policies
      that might grant public access to the bucket.
