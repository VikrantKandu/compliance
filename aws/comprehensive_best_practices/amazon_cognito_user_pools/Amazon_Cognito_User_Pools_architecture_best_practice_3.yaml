    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured as
      private to prevent unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private by default helps maintain data security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by attackers to access,
      modify, or delete sensitive data. By ensuring that buckets are private, you
      minimize the risk of unauthorized data exposure and maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions tab for each bucket to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be public, update the bucket permissions to block
      all public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
    - Enable AWS Config rules to continuously monitor S3 bucket permissions and alert
      on any public access configurations.
