    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to ensure no
      public grants exist.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review any bucket policies or ACLs and remove any public access permissions.
