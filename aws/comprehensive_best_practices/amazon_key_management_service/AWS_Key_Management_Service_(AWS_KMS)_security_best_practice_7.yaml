    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has "Everyone" or "Any authenticated AWS user" granted
      with read or write permissions in the bucket policy or access control list (ACL).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL).
    - Remove any statements granting public access to "Everyone" or "Any authenticated
      AWS user".
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for controlled
      access.
