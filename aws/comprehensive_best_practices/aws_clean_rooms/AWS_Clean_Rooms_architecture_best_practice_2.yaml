  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and use server-side encryption. This is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible or unencrypted can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
      Encrypting data at rest adds an additional layer of security.
  - Audit: 1. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets. 2.
      Verify that each bucket's access control list (ACL) and bucket policy do not
      allow public access. 3. Check that server-side encryption is enabled for each
      bucket. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption to confirm
      encryption settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted and may allow public access
      if not explicitly configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. For each non-compliant bucket, update the ACL and bucket policy
      to restrict public access. 2. Enable server-side encryption using the AWS Management
      Console or AWS CLI. 3. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption
      to apply encryption settings.
