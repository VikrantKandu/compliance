    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless
      explicitly intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized data access, and compliance
      violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to audit. 4. Go to the Permissions tab. 5. Check
      the Bucket Policy and Access Control List (ACL) to ensure no public access is
      granted. 6. Use the Public Access Settings to verify that the bucket does not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation: 1. If public access is not intended, remove any public permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL. 2. Enable Block Public Access settings for the
      bucket. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific
      users or roles.
