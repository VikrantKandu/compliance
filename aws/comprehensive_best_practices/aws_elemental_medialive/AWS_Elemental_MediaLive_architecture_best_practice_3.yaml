    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access
      due to compromised passwords. Without MFA, an attacker with a user's credentials
      could potentially gain full access to your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Step 4: For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking at the "MFA" column.
    - Step 5: Ensure that each user has MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Step 4: Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Step 5: Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Step 6: In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Manage."
    - Step 7: Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
