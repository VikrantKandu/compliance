    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage or unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the risk of sensitive
      data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket BUCKET_NAME
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block Public Access settings and ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
