  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches, compliance violations, and financial loss.
      Ensuring buckets are not public helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block new public access settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the specific bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
