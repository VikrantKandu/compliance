    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This reduces the risk of unauthorized access in case credentials are compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA is crucial to protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, malicious actors
      can gain access to sensitive resources and data, leading to potential data breaches
      and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the steps to assign an MFA device.
