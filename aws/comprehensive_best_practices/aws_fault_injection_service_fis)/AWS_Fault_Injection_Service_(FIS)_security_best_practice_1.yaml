    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users with console access have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on
      top of the username and password, requiring the user to provide a second form
      of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. If a user's credentials are compromised, MFA adds an additional
      barrier that can prevent unauthorized access. Without MFA, there's a higher
      risk of account compromise which can lead to data breaches, resource misuse,
      and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <user-name> to programmatically verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device.
    - Ensure the user successfully configures MFA using the virtual device.
