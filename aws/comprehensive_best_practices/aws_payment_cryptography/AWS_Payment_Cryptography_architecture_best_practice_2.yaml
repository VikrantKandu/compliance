    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only
      a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e.,
      a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand - such
      as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      account compromise. Without MFA, an attacker with access to the root account
      credentials can gain full control over the AWS environment, potentially leading
      to data breaches, unauthorized resource usage, and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on the "Dashboard" in the left navigation pane.
    - Check the "Security Status" section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on "Dashboard" in the left navigation pane.
    - In the "Security Status" section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device.
