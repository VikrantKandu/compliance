    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private to prevent unauthorized access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead
      to data leaks and breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protect sensitive data from
      being accessed by unauthorized individuals. Publicly accessible buckets can
      expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that no bucket has "Public" access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access settings or policies.
    - Apply bucket policies that restrict access to authorized users only.
