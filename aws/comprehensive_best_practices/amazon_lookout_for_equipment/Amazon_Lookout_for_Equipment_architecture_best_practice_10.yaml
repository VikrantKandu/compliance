    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information, which can result in data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions to ensure they are not set to allow public
        access.
    - Step 4: Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to confirm that all public access
        settings are blocked.
    - Step 5: Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to verify they
        do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Step 3: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Enable the S3 Block Public Access settings.
    - Step 5: Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
