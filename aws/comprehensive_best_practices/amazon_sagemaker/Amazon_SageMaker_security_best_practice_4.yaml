    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized public access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets set to public can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket to update.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
