    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access, which may result in data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible is crucial for maintaining data security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to edit the bucket permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy and ACL settings
      to restrict public access.
