    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions to ensure that there are no public access permissions
      set.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for public access control lists (ACLs).
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      inspect the bucket policy for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to remove public 'READ' or 'WRITE' permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account to prevent future public
      access configurations.
