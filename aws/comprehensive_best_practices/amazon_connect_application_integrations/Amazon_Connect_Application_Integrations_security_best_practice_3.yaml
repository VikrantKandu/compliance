    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, meaning
      they do not allow public read or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can
      lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and potential financial and
      reputational damage. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that 'Block all public access'
      settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to review bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to modify bucket policies and ACLs if needed, ensuring no public
      access is granted.
