    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If MFA is not enabled, the root account is vulnerable to
      compromise, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized changes to AWS
      resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA under the "Security Status" section.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the "Security Status" section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the root account.
