    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer
      of protection on top of the username and password by requiring a second form
      of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if the password is compromised. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a
      user's password could gain full access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on 'Users' in the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and click on 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
    - Use the AWS CLI command: aws iam enable-mfa-device to enable MFA for users programmatically.
