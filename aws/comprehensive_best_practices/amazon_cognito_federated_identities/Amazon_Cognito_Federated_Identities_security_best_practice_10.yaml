    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed
      by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data sharing, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) that grant
      public access.
