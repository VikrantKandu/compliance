  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure or unauthorized
      data manipulation.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, compliance violations, and unauthorized
      data access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
      4. Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access. 5. Use the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> and verify
      that the IsPublic attribute is set to false.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access. 2.
      Use the "Block Public Access" feature in the S3 console to block public access
      at the bucket level. 3. Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to
      ensure compliance.
