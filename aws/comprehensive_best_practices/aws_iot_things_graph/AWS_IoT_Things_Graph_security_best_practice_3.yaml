    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide additional
      verification, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, attackers who acquire a user's
      password could gain full access to AWS resources, leading to potential data
      breaches and unauthorized activities.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Click on each user and verify
      that MFA is enabled under 'Security credentials'. 5. Alternatively, use the
      AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list all users and check
      for MFA devices associated with them.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Click on each user
      and choose 'Security credentials'. 5. Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage'
      and follow the prompts to enable MFA. 6. Ensure that all users have MFA enabled
      to comply with security best practices.
