    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring a second form of authentication in addition
      to a password. This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, an attacker with
      a user's password can gain full access to the user's permissions and potentially
      compromise the entire AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage" under the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
