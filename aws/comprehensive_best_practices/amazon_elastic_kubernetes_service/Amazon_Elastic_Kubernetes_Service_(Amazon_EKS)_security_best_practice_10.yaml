    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA provides
      an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form
      of identification beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, accounts are more vulnerable
      to compromise, especially if credentials are leaked or stolen.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify whether MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to check MFA devices for each
        user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the instructions to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure that the user registers the MFA device and tests it for successful authentication.
