  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled for an additional layer of security. MFA requires
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access, enhancing
      security by reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users mitigates the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to unauthorized
      access to your AWS environment, resulting in potential data breaches and unauthorized
      resource usage.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the IAM Dashboard, check the "Security Status" section for MFA status.
      4. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list all users
      and aws iam get-login-profile --user-name <username> to check MFA status for
      each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In
      the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow
      the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
