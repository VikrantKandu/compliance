    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide not
      only a password or access key but also a second form of authentication, typically
      a code from a mobile device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect your AWS accounts by requiring a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if credentials
      are compromised. Without MFA, attackers can easily access your AWS resources
      if they obtain your IAM credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Check each user to ensure MFA is enabled by verifying the "MFA" column in the
      user list.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user using a supported MFA device.
