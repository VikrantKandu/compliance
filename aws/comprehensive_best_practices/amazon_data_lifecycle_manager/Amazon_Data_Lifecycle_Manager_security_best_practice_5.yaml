    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS
      IAM users to enhance security by enforcing password complexity and expiration.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials by requiring users to create complex passwords and change them regularly.
      Without this, accounts may be more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Check the 'Password policy' section to verify that a password policy is enabled
      and configured according to best practices, such as requiring at least one uppercase
      letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric character, with a minimum length
      of 8 characters.
    Default Value: By default, no password policy is enforced for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Under the 'Password policy' section, enable and configure a password policy
      that meets security best practices.
    - Save changes to enforce the new password policy.
