    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Launched in a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual
      Private Cloud (VPC). Launching instances in a VPC increases security by providing
      network isolation and control over inbound and outbound traffic.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in a VPC is recommended because it provides
      enhanced security features, such as security groups and network access control
      lists (ACLs). Without a VPC, instances may be exposed to the public internet,
      increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the 'Instances' section to ensure each instance is associated with a VPC.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and verify that each instance
      has a 'VpcId' attribute.
    Default Value: By default, instances are launched in the default VPC if no specific
      VPC is selected.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not launched in a VPC.
    - Stop the instance and create an AMI.
    - Launch a new instance from the AMI within a VPC.
    - Terminate the original instance not in a VPC.
