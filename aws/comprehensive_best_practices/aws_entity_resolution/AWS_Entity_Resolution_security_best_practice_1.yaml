  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible and it is not required, remove the public
      access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Modify the ACL to remove public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
