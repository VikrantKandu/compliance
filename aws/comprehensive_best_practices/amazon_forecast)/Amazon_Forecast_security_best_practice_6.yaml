    Title: Ensure EC2 Security Groups are Configured Correctly
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances
      to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Ensuring they are configured correctly
      is crucial for maintaining the security of your instances.
    Rationale: Improperly configured security groups can expose your EC2 instances
      to unauthorized access and potential attacks. By ensuring security groups are
      correctly set up, you minimize the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Security Groups from the left-hand menu.
    - Review the inbound and outbound rules for each security group.
    - Ensure that only necessary ports are open and that IP ranges are restricted
      to only those that need access.
    Default Value: By default, new security groups have no inbound rules, meaning
      no inbound traffic is allowed, and all outbound traffic is allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Identify security groups with overly permissive rules.
    - Modify inbound and outbound rules to restrict access to only necessary IP addresses
      and ports.
    - Regularly review and update security group rules to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
