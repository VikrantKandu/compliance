    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks. Public access to S3 buckets should
      be restricted to secure sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps maintain data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Confirm that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Check bucket policies to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings on all S3 buckets.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to S3
      buckets.
