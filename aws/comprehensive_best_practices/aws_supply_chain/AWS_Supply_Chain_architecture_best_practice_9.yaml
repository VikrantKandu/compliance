    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps to secure
      AWS accounts by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised accounts
      by requiring an additional authentication factor. This is especially important
      for accounts with sensitive permissions or access to critical resources. Without
      MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access through compromised
      credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Users' section.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <user-name> for each user to verify MFA devices
      are configured.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Click on each user for whom MFA is not enabled.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
