    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a device with an MFA code. This ensures
      that even if a user's password is compromised, the account remains secure.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker
      can gain full access to the user's permissions and potentially cause harm to
      the infrastructure.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the specific
      user for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Under 'Security credentials', click
      'Manage MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device
      for the user.
