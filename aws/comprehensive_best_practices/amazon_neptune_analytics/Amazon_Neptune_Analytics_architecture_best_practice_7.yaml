    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private helps protect sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies do not allow public access by reviewing policies
      using the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket ACLs to remove public access.
    - Modify bucket policies to restrict public access.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the
      account or bucket level.
