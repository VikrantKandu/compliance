    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide more than one form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all virtual MFA devices and verify their status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to configure and enable MFA for the user.
