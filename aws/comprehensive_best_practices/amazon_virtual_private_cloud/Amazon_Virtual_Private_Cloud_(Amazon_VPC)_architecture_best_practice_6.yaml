    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Unrestricted public access can lead
      to data leaks and security vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
