    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to an account,
      making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access sensitive data
      and resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS
      account, so compromising this account can lead to severe security breaches,
      including data loss, service disruption, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and then choose the root account.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Verify that a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device is assigned and active.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Security credentials".
    - In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Activate MFA".
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the root
      account.
    - Confirm MFA is active by requiring MFA during the next login attempt.
