    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Launched in VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and enhanced security features.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in a VPC provides an isolated network environment,
      allowing for better control over network traffic and security. Instances outside
      a VPC may be exposed to the public internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Verify that all instances are listed under a specific VPC column, indicating
      they are launched within a VPC.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC if no
      specific VPC is chosen.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Launch Instance' and choose the appropriate AMI.
    - In the 'Configure Instance Details' step, select a specific VPC from the 'Network'
      dropdown.
    - Complete the instance launch process.
