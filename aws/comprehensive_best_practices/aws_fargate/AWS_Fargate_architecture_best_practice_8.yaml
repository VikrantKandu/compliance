    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access, which
      can compromise sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
