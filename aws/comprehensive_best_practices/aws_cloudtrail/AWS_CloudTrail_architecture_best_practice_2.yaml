  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      by default, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and leakage
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that "Block all public
      access" settings are enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow
      public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access unless configured
      otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket you want to modify. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable
      "Block all public access" settings. 5. Review and adjust bucket policies and
      ACLs to prevent public access.
