    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a physical token or a smartphone app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial for protecting AWS accounts from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the AWS environment, leading to potential
      data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
        list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to programmatically verify MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user to open their details.
    - Under the 'Security Credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
