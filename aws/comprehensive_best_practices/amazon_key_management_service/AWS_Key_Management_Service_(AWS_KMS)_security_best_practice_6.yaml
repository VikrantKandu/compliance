    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFront Distributions Are Encrypted with TLS 1.2 or Higher
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFront distributions enforce
      the use of TLS 1.2 or higher for encryption. TLS 1.2 provides enhanced security
      features that protect data in transit.
    Rationale: Using outdated versions of TLS can expose data to vulnerabilities and
      attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Ensuring the use of TLS 1.2 or higher
      enhances data security and compliance with industry standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select each distribution and check the Viewer Protocol Policy.
    - Ensure that the policy enforces HTTPS and specifies TLS 1.2 or higher.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFront distributions may allow lower versions of
      TLS.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select the distribution that is not compliant.
    - Edit the Viewer Protocol Policy to enforce HTTPS and specify TLS 1.2 or higher.
    - Save the changes and verify the distribution settings.
