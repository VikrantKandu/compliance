    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      is crucial for maintaining data security and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the Access column for each bucket to ensure it is not set to Public.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Choose the Permissions tab.
    - Under Block public access (bucket settings), click Edit.
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
