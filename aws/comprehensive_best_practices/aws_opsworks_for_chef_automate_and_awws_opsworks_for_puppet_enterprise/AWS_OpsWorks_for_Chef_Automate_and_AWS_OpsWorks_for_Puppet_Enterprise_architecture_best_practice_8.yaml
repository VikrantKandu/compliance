    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      data access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Check the bucket policy for statements that allow public access.
    - Verify the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Update the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
