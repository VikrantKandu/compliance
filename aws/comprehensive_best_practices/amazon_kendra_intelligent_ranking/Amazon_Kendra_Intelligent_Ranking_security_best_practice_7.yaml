    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      entities, posing a significant security risk.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets can be configured to allow public access, which
      can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed. Restricting public
      access helps safeguard data and comply with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, but permissions can be modified
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
