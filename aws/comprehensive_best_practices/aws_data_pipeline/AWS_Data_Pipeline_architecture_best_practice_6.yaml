    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the
      user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have
      immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly increases the security of
      the AWS account by requiring additional verification. Without MFA, if a user's
      credentials are compromised, the account is vulnerable to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security Credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-Factor Authentication section, choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
