    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are using IAM Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are using IAM roles to manage access
      to AWS resources securely. This practice helps in managing permissions at a
      granular level and avoids the need for storing AWS credentials on the instance.
    Rationale: Using IAM roles for EC2 instances ensures that applications running
      on these instances can securely access AWS resources without the need for embedding
      AWS credentials in the instance. This reduces the risk of credential leakage
      and enhances security by leveraging temporary credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the IAM Role column to verify if an IAM role is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and review
      the IAM Instance Profile section for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role assigned.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Stop the EC2 instance if it is running.
    - Select the instance and choose Actions, then Instance Settings, and Attach/Replace
      IAM Role.
    - Select the appropriate IAM role from the dropdown and apply changes.
    - Start the EC2 instance if necessary.
