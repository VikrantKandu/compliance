    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that no S3 buckets are publicly accessible unless absolutely
      necessary. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Restricting access minimizes the risk of data exposure and ensures compliance
      with data protection standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Permissions' tab for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings on the bucket.
    - Review and update any ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
