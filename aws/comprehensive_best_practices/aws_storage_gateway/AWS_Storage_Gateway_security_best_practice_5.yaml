    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private by default
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be explicitly granted only when necessary.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default minimizes the risk
      of accidental data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings. 4. Verify that
      the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is not compliant. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab.
      5. Enable "Block all public access" to ensure the bucket is private.
