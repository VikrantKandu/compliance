    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that a strong IAM password policy is configured to enhance
      the security of user accounts in AWS. A strong password policy includes requirements
      for minimum password length, complexity, and rotation.
    Rationale: Configuring a strong IAM password policy helps protect AWS accounts
      from unauthorized access by enforcing the use of complex passwords and regular
      password changes. Without a strong password policy, accounts are more vulnerable
      to brute force attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on "Account settings."
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and that it includes the following settings:
      - Require at least one uppercase letter
      - Require at least one lowercase letter
      - Require at least one number
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters
      - Require users to change their password after 90 days
      - Prevent password reuse
    Default Value: By default, no password policy is configured in AWS IAM.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on "Account settings."
    - Click on "Edit" in the Password Policy section.
    - Configure the password policy with the recommended settings.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
