    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      This ensures sensitive data is not exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are not public is crucial for data security and
      compliance.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that 'Block all
      public access' is enabled. 5. Verify bucket policies and access control lists
      (ACLs) do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access'. 6. Review and update bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
