    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Logging Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server access logging
      enabled. Server access logs provide detailed records for requests made to a
      bucket, which can help in security and access audits.
    Rationale: Enabling logging on S3 buckets is recommended to track access requests.
      This helps in identifying unauthorized access or potential data breaches. Without
      logging, it is challenging to trace access patterns or investigate security
      incidents.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check if server access logging is enabled by reviewing
        the bucket properties.
    - Step 4: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-logging
        --bucket <bucket-name> to verify if logging is configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have logging enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket for which you want to enable logging.
    - Step 4: Go to the Properties tab and select Server access logging.
    - Step 5: Choose a target bucket and a target prefix for the logs.
    - Step 6: Save the changes to enable logging.
