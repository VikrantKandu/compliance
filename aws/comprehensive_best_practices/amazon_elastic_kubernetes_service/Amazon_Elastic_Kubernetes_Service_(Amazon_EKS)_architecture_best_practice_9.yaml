    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access,
      which adds an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      potentially gain full access to the account. MFA significantly reduces this
      risk by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS
      CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and verify that all users have
      MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and select
      'Manage MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for
      the user.
