  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data breaches and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is critical to safeguarding
      sensitive data. Public buckets can expose data to unauthorized users, leading
      to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and their access policies. 4. Check for any bucket
      with public access settings enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify access control lists. 6. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket policies
      for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. For each publicly accessible bucket, review and modify the bucket
      policy to restrict access. 2. Use the AWS Management Console to disable public
      access settings. 3. Update the bucket's ACL to remove any public permissions.
      4. Implement Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
