    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Restricting public access helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check for any public access settings or policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and remove any settings or policies that allow public
      access.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting to prevent future public access
      configurations.
