    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets are a common source of data leaks. Ensuring
      that buckets are not public helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions and access policies.
    - Confirm that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies to restrict public access.
