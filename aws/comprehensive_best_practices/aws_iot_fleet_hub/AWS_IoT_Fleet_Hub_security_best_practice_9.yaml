  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification when logging in, significantly
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect the AWS environment from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to compromised passwords, which
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions within the AWS environment.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that all users have
      MFA devices assigned.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and click
      on 'Manage MFA device'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA
      device for the user.
