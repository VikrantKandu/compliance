    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication in addition to their password. This helps protect
      user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is exposed, their account can
      be easily accessed by unauthorized parties, potentially leading to data breaches
      or unauthorized changes to resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - Check each user to ensure they have 'MFA' enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam get-login-profile --user-name <username>' to verify MFA status for each
      user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Choose a user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
    - Repeat for all users who do not have MFA enabled.
