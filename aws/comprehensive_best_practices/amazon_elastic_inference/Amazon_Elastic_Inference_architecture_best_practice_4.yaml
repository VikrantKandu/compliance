    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the account, and a compromised root account can lead to severe security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Activate MFA on your root account' and follow the instructions to set
      up MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
