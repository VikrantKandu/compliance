    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are private by default
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be explicitly granted only when necessary.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default minimizes the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to the public internet, which could lead to data breaches or
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to only authorized
      users or services.
