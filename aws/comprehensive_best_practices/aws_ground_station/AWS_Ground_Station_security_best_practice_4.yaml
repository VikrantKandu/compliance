  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could expose sensitive data to the internet. It is crucial
      to restrict public access to prevent unauthorized data leaks.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the 'Permissions' tab for each bucket. 4. Ensure that no bucket policies
      or ACLs allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      to programmatically check bucket permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have public access enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and
      ACL. 2. Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket. 3. Regularly review
      bucket permissions to ensure compliance with best practices.
