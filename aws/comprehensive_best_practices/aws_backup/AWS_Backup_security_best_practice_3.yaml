    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps
      protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that the "Block all public
      access" setting is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    - Verify bucket policies using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL if necessary.
