    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      services and data, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the security group associated with each instance.
    - Ensure that no instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your application's needs.
    - Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Remove the association of the default security group from the instances.
