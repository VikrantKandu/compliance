    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private mitigates the risk of unauthorized data
      access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to exposure
      of sensitive information, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have 'Public' permissions enabled.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
