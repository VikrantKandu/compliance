    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets may be accessible to the public, which can lead
      to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed. Ensuring that buckets
      are private helps protect data from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are publicly accessible by default if not configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
