    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by the organization. Approved AMIs typically have the
      necessary security patches and configurations to meet organizational standards.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can lead to instances with vulnerabilities or
      misconfigurations, posing security risks to the organization. Ensuring that
      only approved AMIs are used helps maintain a secure and compliant environment.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select Instances from the left menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the AMI ID used.
    - Step 5: Verify that the AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained
        by the organization.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Action 2: Create an AMI from an approved instance configuration.
    - Action 3: Launch new instances using the approved AMI.
    - Action 4: Terminate instances that are not compliant, after ensuring data is
        backed up and services are migrated.
