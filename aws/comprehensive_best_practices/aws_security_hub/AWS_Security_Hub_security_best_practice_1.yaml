    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security on top of
      a username and password, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals
      to access your AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who has obtained
      a user's password could potentially gain full access to the AWS account.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the
      "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6.
      Under "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)", choose "Manage". 7. Follow the instructions
      to enable MFA for the user.
