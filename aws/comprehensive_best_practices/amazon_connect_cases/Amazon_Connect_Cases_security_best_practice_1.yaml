    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets is a best practice to protect against
      accidental or malicious deletion of objects. Versioning allows you to preserve,
      retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets.
    Rationale: Without versioning, any mistakenly deleted or overwritten object cannot
      be recovered, leading to potential data loss. Versioning provides an additional
      layer of data protection and recovery.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to inspect.
    - Check the 'Properties' tab for the 'Versioning' status.
    - Ensure that versioning is enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have versioning disabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket for which you want to enable versioning.
    - Click on the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Bucket Versioning', click 'Edit' and enable versioning.
    - Save the changes.
