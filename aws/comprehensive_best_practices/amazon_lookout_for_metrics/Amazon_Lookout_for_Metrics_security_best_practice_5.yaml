    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of stored data. Public access can
      lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, compliance violations, and financial losses.
      Restricting access to authorized users only mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that public access settings are configured to block all public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the "Block public access" settings to ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
