    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to safeguard sensitive
      information and maintain data privacy. Publicly accessible buckets increase
      the risk of data exposure and unauthorized access, potentially leading to data
      loss or compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
        bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
        bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use AWS CLI commands to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
