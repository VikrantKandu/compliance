    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible protects data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings. 4. Verify that
      the settings are configured to block all public access. 5. Alternatively, use
      the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and check
      for any public grants.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Choose the "Permissions" tab. 4.
      Edit the "Block Public Access" settings and ensure all options are checked to
      block public access. 5. Save the changes to apply the new settings.
