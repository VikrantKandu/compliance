  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security. MFA adds
      an additional layer of protection on top of a username and password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, a compromised password can lead to unauthorized
      actions and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard and select 'Users'. 3. Choose the user for whom you want to enable
      MFA. 4. Select the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. Under 'Assigned MFA device',
      choose 'Manage'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device to the
      user.
