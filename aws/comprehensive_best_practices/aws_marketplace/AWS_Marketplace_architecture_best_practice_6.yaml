    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure. It is crucial to control access to S3 buckets
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Unauthorized access can lead
      to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as "Public". 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name. 5. Go to the Permissions
      tab and verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab.
      5. Click on 'Edit' under 'Block public access (bucket settings)'. 6. Enable
      'Block all public access' and save changes. 7. Review and remove any bucket
      policies or ACLs that allow public access.
