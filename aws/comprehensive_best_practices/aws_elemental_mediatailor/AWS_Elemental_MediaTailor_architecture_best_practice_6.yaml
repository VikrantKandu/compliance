    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Regularly update EC2 instances to use the latest Amazon Machine Images
      (AMIs) to ensure they include the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose EC2 instances to security vulnerabilities
      and bugs that have been addressed in newer versions. Keeping AMIs up to date
      is a critical step in maintaining a secure cloud environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Review the AMI ID of running instances and compare it with the latest available
      AMIs.
    - Verify that the AMI ID matches the latest version for the respective operating
      system.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may be launched with older AMIs if not explicitly
      updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances running outdated AMIs.
    - Plan and execute an update process to launch new instances with the latest AMIs.
    - Migrate applications and data to the new instances and terminate the old ones.
