    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, restricting public access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, reducing the risk of data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can change
      over time.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to ensure the bucket is private.
