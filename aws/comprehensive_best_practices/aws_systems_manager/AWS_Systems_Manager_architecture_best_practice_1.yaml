    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by your organization. Using approved AMIs helps maintain
      consistency and security across your infrastructure.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities and inconsistencies
      in your environment. Approved AMIs are vetted for security and compliance, ensuring
      that instances are secure and meet organizational standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that the AMI IDs match those on the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by your organization.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any public or private AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan for replacement or re-launch of these instances using approved AMIs.
    - Update internal policies and procedures to ensure future instances use approved
      AMIs.
