    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that an IAM password policy is enabled to enforce
      strong password requirements for AWS users. A strong password policy helps protect
      AWS accounts by requiring users to create complex passwords that are harder
      to guess or crack.
    Rationale: Enabling a strong IAM password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources by enforcing the use of complex passwords. Without a
      strong password policy, users may set weak passwords, increasing the likelihood
      of account compromise.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings."
    - Verify that a password policy is enabled and configured with the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters
      - Require at least one uppercase letter
      - Require at least one lowercase letter
      - Require at least one number
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character
      - Password expiration period of 90 days or less
      - Prevent password reuse for at least 3 previous passwords
    Default Value: By default, no password policy is enforced on AWS IAM accounts.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings."
    - Enable and configure a password policy with the recommended settings mentioned
      in the audit section.
