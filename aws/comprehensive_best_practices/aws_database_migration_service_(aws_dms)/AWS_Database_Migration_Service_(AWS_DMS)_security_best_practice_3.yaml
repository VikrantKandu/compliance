    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access to enhance security by requiring a second form
      of authentication.
    Rationale: MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      leading to unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' and select 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate a virtual or hardware MFA device for the user.
