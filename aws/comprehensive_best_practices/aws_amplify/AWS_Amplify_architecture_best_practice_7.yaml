    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: If S3 buckets are publicly accessible, sensitive data can be exposed
      to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket is configured with public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and bucket policy.
    - Remove any public access permissions and update the bucket policy to restrict
      access to specific users or roles.
