    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling MFA for IAM users provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication in addition
      to their password.
    Rationale: Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access,
      which can lead to data breaches or other security incidents. MFA significantly
      reduces the risk of compromised accounts by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the 'Users' section and review each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify that each user has an MFA
      device associated.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the instructions to enable
      MFA.
    - Repeat for each user account that does not have MFA enabled.
