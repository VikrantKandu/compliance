    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and pose a security
      risk.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      that they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
