    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored within. This can
      lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      they do not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to verify that public access settings
      are appropriately configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for the account and individual buckets.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access settings to ensure compliance.
