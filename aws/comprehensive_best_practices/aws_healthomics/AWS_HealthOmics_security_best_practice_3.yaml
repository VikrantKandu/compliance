    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to safeguarding sensitive
      information and maintaining compliance with security standards. Public exposure
      can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policy grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on 'Permissions'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save changes to ensure buckets are not publicly accessible.
