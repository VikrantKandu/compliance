    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in AWS S3 buckets.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets are private, but misconfigurations can lead
      to data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Access Control List (ACL) to confirm it is not granting public or
      unauthorized access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account
      level.
