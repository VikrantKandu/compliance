    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that no S3 buckets in the AWS account are publicly
      accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and non-compliance with data protection regulations. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Under the "Permissions" tab, modify the bucket policy to remove any public access
      permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
