    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required and justified.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the "Access" column to ensure no bucket
      is publicly accessible.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and
      verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
