    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to present multiple forms of identification before accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect the AWS account from unauthorized
      access. If MFA is not enabled, users can access AWS resources with just a password,
      increasing the risk of account compromise.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Check the column for MFA for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
