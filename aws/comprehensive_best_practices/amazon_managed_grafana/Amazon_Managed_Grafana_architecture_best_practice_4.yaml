    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized access and data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure and
      potential data breaches. Restricting public access helps maintain data privacy
      and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) grant public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent accidental public
      exposure.
