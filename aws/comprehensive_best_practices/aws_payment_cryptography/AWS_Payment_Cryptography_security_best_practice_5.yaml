    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect their AWS resources by adding
      an additional layer of security. Without MFA, if a password is compromised,
      an attacker could potentially gain access to AWS resources. MFA significantly
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select Users.
    - For each user, check if there is an MFA device assigned.
    - You can also use AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users
      without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select Users.
    - Choose the user that you want to enable MFA for.
    - Select the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
