    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive information
      is stored within them.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      access to authenticated users only mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the Permissions tab, and verify
      that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and click on "Edit" under the "Block public access"
      settings.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
