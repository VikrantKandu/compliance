    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading to data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and complies with security best practices.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Check the 'Block public
      access' settings and ensure all options are enabled. 5. Review the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Click on the 'Permissions'
      tab and enable 'Block all public access'. 5. Review and modify the bucket policy
      and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
