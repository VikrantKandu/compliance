    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an additional
      layer of protection on top of a username and password by requiring an additional
      form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials from being
      compromised. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is exposed, unauthorized
      access to AWS resources can occur, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      actions.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user in the list, check the "MFA" column to see if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command "aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices" to
      list all virtual MFA devices and verify that each user has an associated MFA
      device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
