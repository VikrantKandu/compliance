    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFormation stacks have encryption
      enabled to protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption for CloudFormation stacks helps protect sensitive
      information that may be included in stack templates or outputs. Without encryption,
      data could be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches
      or compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select each stack and verify that encryption is enabled under the
      stack's properties. 4. Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws cloudformation
      describe-stacks to check the encryption settings for each stack.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stacks do not have encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Identify stacks without encryption. 2. Update the stack template
      to include encryption settings. 3. Redeploy the stack with the updated template
      to ensure encryption is enabled.
