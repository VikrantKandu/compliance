    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private and
      do not allow public access. This is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACLs for each bucket to ensure public access is
      not allowed.
    - Use AWS Config or Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to verify that public
      access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may be altered
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 console and select the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent any public access configurations.
