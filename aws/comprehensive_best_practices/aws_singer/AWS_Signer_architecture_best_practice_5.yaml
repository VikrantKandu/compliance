    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to ensure sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Public access
      to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to potential data breaches and
      compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
