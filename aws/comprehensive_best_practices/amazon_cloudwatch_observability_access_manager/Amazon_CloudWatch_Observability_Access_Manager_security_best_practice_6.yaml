    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect data from unauthorized
      access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to data loss or exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Re-evaluate the need for any exceptions to ensure they are justified and documented.
