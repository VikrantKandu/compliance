    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive information,
      and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for public indicators.
    - Click on each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify bucket
        ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
        bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
