    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and loss of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and
      potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for public access indicators.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      bucket policy JSON.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review the bucket policy and remove any public access permissions.
    - Disable "Block public access" settings if enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
