    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users
      to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's credentials can
      easily access AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized
      actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user and choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
