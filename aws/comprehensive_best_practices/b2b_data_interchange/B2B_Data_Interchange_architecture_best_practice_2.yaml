    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users is a best
      practice to protect your AWS environment from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials by requiring
      a second form of verification. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the account.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the steps to
      assign an MFA device.
