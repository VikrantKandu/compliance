    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password but also a second factor
      of authentication. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: "Requiring MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized\
      \ access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user\u2019s credentials are compromised,\
      \ an attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions, potentially leading\
      \ to data breaches or unauthorized resource usage."
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select each user and check the
      "Security credentials" tab. 5. Verify that "Assigned MFA device" is configured
      for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. In the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage"
      under "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)". 6. Follow the instructions to assign
      an MFA device to the user.
