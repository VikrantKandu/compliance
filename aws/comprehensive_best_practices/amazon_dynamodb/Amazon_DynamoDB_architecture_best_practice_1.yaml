    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Restricting access helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the Block public
      access settings to ensure that public access is blocked. 5. Review the bucket
      policy and ensure it does not allow public access. 6. Examine the Access Control
      List (ACL) to verify that public access is not enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on the Permissions tab. 4.
      Enable all options under Block public access settings. 5. Remove any bucket
      policies or ACLs that grant public access. 6. Save the changes to apply the
      new settings.
