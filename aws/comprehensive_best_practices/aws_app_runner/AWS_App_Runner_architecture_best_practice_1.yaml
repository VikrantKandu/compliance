    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in
      addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, as unauthorized access is prevented even if passwords are stolen.
      Without MFA, attackers can gain access to AWS resources using only a password,
      which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized resource manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled and compare against the total list of users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users.'
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA.'
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
