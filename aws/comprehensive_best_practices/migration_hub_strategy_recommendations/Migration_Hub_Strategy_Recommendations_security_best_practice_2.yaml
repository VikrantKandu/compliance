    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      protects data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use AWS Config to continuously monitor and alert on any changes to bucket permissions.
