    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires not only
      a password and username but also something that only the user possesses, making
      it more difficult for unauthorized users to access the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the AWS root account significantly reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access. If the root account is compromised, it can lead to severe
      security breaches, including data loss and unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section for MFA on the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - In the 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or
      hardware MFA device.
