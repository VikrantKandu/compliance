  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be read
      or written to by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security risk.
  - Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public
      exposure can lead to data leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review ACL settings.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and
      ACL. 2. Apply a bucket policy that explicitly denies public access. 3. Use AWS
      S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account or bucket
      level.
