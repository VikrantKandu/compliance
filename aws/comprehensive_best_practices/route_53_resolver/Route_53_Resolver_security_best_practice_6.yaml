    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets may lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no public access policies attached to the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if it is not already enabled.
    - Remove any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow public
      access.
