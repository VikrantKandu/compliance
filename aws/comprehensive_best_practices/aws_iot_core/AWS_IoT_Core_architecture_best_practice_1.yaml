    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to unintended access.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks by allowing unrestricted access. This could lead to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Security Groups from the left-hand menu.
    - Identify the default security group and note its Group ID.
    - Go to the Instances section and check the associated security groups for each
      instance.
    - Ensure no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that align
      with your security requirements.
    - Detach the default security group from any EC2 instances.
    - Attach the newly created security group to the instances.
