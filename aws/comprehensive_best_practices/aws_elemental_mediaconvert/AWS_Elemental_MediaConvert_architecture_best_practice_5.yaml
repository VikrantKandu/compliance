    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that the AWS root account has Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because it is the most
      privileged account in an AWS environment. Without MFA, the account is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches or infrastructure compromise.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Dashboard'. 4. Check the 'Security Status'
      section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Dashboard'. 4. In the
      'Security Status' section, click 'Activate MFA on your root account'. 5. Follow
      the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device, hardware MFA device, or
      other supported methods.
