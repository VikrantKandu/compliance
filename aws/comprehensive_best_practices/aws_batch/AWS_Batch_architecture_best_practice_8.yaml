    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of user accounts by requiring a
      second factor of authentication. This reduces the likelihood of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources, thus protecting sensitive data
      and operations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - For each user, go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
