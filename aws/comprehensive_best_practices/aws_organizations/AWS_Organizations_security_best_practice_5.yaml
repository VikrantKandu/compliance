    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance account security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to AWS accounts, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to
      compromise if passwords are stolen or guessed.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select Users.
    - Choose the user and open the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA.
