    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. It is crucial to configure S3
      buckets with the least privilege principle to protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps mitigate the risk
      of data breaches and protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and edit the bucket policy to remove any public access
      statements.
    - Adjust the ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access configurations.
