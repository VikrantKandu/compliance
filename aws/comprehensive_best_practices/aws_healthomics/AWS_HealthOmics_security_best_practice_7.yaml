    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data exposure and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled and no bucket policies or Access
      Control Lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to remove any statements
      that grant public access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and update ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
