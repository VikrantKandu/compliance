    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security.
      MFA adds an additional layer of protection on top of a username and password,
      requiring users to provide a unique authentication code generated by a physical
      or virtual MFA device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker can gain full access to the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring
      a second form of verification.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA' column to
      ensure that MFA is enabled for each user. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose 'Security credentials' tab and click
      'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)'. 6. Follow the prompts to
      assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
