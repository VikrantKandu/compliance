    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to safeguarding sensitive
      information. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block all public access' settings. Ensure that all options are enabled.
    - Review bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
