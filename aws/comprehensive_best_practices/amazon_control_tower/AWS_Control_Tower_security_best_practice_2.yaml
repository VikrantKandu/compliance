    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top
      of regular username and password authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to potential
      data breaches and unauthorized actions within the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the 'Security Credentials' tab and click on
      'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user using a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device.
