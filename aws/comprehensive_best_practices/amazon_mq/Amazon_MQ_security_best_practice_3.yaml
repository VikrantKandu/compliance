    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check to ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow
        public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>'
        to check ACL settings.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name>'
        to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Step 5: Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Step 6: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or specific buckets.
