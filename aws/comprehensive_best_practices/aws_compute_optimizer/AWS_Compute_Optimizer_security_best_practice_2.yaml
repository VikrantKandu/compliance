    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to
      present two or more separate forms of identification before accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials, as it requires
      additional verification beyond just a password. If MFA is not enabled, unauthorized
      access to AWS resources can occur if passwords are stolen or compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security credentials" tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA for the user.
