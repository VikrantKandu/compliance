    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that S3 bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy grants public access (e.g., principal set to '*').
    - Verify that the ACL does not grant 'Everyone' or 'Authenticated Users' any permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Adjust the ACL to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
