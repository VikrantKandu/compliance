  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access permissions
      enabled. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and security
      breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, increasing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the public access settings are configured to block all public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Edit" under "Block public access".
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
