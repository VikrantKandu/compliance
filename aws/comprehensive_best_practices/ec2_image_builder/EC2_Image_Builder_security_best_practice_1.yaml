    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to restrict public access to ensure
      that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. This involves setting
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to deny public access unless
      explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data
      exposure and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the 'Block all public access' setting and ensure it is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs to confirm no public access permissions are
      granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit buckets to ensure compliance with the best practice.
