    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a risk of exposing
      sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      data is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that no bucket is publicly accessible unless explicitly required.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket permissions and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use bucket policies to restrict access to only authorized users or roles.
