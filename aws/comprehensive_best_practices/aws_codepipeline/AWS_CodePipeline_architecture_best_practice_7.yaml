    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches or leaks.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential misuse. Publicly accessible buckets can
      be exploited by attackers to gain access to confidential information, leading
      to security incidents and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to further
      restrict access.
