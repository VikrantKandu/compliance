  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly intended. Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches as they expose
      data to anyone on the internet. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that the settings are configured to block all public access unless there
      is a specific requirement.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block Public Access".
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
