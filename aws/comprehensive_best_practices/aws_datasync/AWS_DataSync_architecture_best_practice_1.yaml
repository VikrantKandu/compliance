    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized data
      exposure and reduces the risk of data breaches. Public buckets can be accessed
      by anyone on the internet, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public read or write permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable the Block Public Access feature for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
