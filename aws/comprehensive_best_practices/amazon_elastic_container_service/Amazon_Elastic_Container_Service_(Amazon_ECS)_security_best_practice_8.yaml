    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS S3 buckets are configured to be private
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should not be publicly
      accessible unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and their access policies.
    - Verify that each bucket's access policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the access control list (ACL) for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
