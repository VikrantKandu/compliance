    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Secure
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and secure. Public access should be restricted unless explicitly required,
      and appropriate permissions should be set to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive
      data to the public internet. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data access, which can have serious compliance and security
      implications.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access unless explicitly required.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab of the bucket.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and remove any policies or ACLs granting public
      access.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure only authorized users
      have access.
