    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Rationale: It is recommended to restrict public access to S3 buckets to prevent
      unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that all public access settings are enabled to block public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket ACL and ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable all settings under "Block Public Access" to prevent public access.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
