    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      settings that could expose sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets pose
      a risk of data exposure to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to adjust bucket settings and policies to restrict
      public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Modify or delete any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and specific buckets.
