    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored. Public accessibility
      can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks, unauthorized access, and potential compliance violations.
      Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and check the permissions tab. 4. Ensure that there are no
      public access permissions set. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the ACL settings. 6. Check the bucket policy
      for statements that allow public access using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL. 2. Update
      the bucket policy to restrict public access. 3. Enable 'Block Public Access'
      settings on the bucket. 4. Regularly review and audit bucket permissions and
      policies to ensure compliance.
