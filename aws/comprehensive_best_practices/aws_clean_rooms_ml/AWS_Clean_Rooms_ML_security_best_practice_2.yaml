    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Unaccessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
