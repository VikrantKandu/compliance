    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public access can be controlled using bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs).
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By restricting public access, you minimize
      the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm public access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
