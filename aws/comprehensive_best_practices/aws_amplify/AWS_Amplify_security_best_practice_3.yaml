    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Configured with IAM Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are configured with IAM roles to manage
      access to AWS resources securely. IAM roles provide temporary credentials, reducing
      the need for storing long-term credentials on instances.
    Rationale: Configuring EC2 instances with IAM roles is recommended to enhance
      security by minimizing the risk of credential exposure. Without IAM roles, applications
      may store long-term AWS credentials on instances, increasing the risk of unauthorized
      access if the instance is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the navigation pane.
    - Review the IAM role column for each instance.
    - Verify that all instances have an associated IAM role.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role assigned.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances without an IAM role.
    - Create or identify an appropriate IAM role with the necessary permissions.
    - Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instances by selecting the instance, choosing
      Actions, then Security, and selecting Modify IAM Role.
