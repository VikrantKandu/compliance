    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to user accounts,
      reducing the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are leaked or guessed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "Security credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab and click on "Manage" in the "Assigned
      MFA device" section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
