    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to limit access
      to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets to only authorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible,
      you reduce the risk of data leaks and comply with data protection standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket's ACL does not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Remove any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL to remove public read or write permissions.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access configurations.
