    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive information. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and compromise of confidential information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that they are not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket ACLs.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update its ACL to remove any public access
      permissions.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
