    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should have policies
      and permissions set to restrict access only to authorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps protect data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket. 4. Ensure that
      no bucket has a policy allowing public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify bucket ACLs do not grant
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy to remove public access permissions. 2. Use the AWS Management Console
      or CLI to modify the bucket ACLs and policies. 3. Implement AWS Identity and
      Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to grant access only to authorized
      users or services.
