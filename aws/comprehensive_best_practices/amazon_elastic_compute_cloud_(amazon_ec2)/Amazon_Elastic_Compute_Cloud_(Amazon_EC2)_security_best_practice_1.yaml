    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs that are approved
      by the organization to maintain consistency, security, and compliance.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are configured according
      to organizational standards, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring
      compliance with security policies. Unapproved AMIs may contain insecure configurations
      or unauthorized software.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID and verify it against the list of approved
      AMIs maintained by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched from any publicly available
      or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any EC2 instances not using an approved AMI.
    - Stop the non-compliant instance.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate data and configurations from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance once migration is complete.
