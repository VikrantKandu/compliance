    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with default
      security groups. Default security groups allow all inbound traffic from other
      instances in the same security group, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can expose instances to unnecessary risk
      by allowing unrestricted inbound access. This can lead to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select Instances and identify instances associated with the default
        security group.
    - Step 4: Verify if any instance is using the default security group by checking
        the security group settings under the Description tab.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Select Instances and choose the instance associated with the default
        security group.
    - Action 3: Click on Actions > Networking > Change Security Groups.
    - Action 4: Select a custom security group with specific inbound rules and click
        on Assign Security Groups.
