  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in AWS S3. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data
      breaches.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be a significant security
      risk as they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored within.
      This can lead to data leakage, compliance violations, and unauthorized data
      manipulation.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      and ACLs do not allow public access. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to review the ACLs. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review and modify
      the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access. 2. Use the AWS S3 Block
      Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account or bucket level.
      3. Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with
      security best practices.
