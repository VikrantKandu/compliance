    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      and not publicly accessible. S3 buckets should have appropriate permissions
      to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket's Access Control List (ACL) does not grant public read
      or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the ACL to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
