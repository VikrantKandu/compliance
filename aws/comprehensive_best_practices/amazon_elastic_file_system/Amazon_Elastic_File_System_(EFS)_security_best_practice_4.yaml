  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using the Latest AMI
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to leverage the latest security patches and
      updates.
  - Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer versions. Ensuring the use of the latest AMI helps in
      maintaining security and stability.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, note the AMI ID
      being used. 5. Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the operating
      system in use. 6. Verify if the instance is using the latest AMI version.
  - Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI if not specified
      during launch.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances not using the latest AMI. 2. Plan for an update
      by creating new instances with the latest AMI. 3. Migrate workloads from the
      old instance to the new instance. 4. Terminate the old instance once migration
      is complete.
