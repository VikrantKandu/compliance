    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: It is a best practice to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      for all IAM users in AWS. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a one-time code
      from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, even if a user's password is compromised. Without MFA,
      an attacker with a user's password could gain full access to AWS resources,
      potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam get-user' for each user to verify the MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the user's details page, select 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage' and follow the instructions to
      assign an MFA device to the user.
