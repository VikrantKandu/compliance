    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can pose a security risk if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unrestricted access to
      EC2 instances, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security
      breaches. By ensuring instances are associated with custom security groups,
      you can enforce stricter access controls.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security Groups' column.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the application's needs.
    - Associate the new security group with the affected instances.
    - Remove the default security group association from these instances.
