  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
      Public access should be restricted unless explicitly required.
  - Rationale: By default, S3 buckets can be made public, which poses a risk of data
      exposure. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the risk of unauthorized access
      and data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for each bucket.
      4. Ensure that each bucket is not marked as 'Public'. 5. Alternatively, use
      the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL configuration and confirm it does not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have public access unless explicitly
      configured.
  - Remediation: 1. For each bucket that is public, navigate to the bucket settings
      in the AWS Management Console. 2. Under the 'Permissions' tab, disable 'Block
      all public access'. 3. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket
      policy or ACL. 4. Consider enabling 'Block Public Access' at the account level
      for additional security.
