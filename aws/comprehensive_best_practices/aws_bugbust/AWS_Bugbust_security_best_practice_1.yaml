    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to the
      password. This helps protect sensitive resources and data from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised accounts by adding an
      additional layer of security beyond just a password. Without MFA, an attacker
      who gains access to a user's password can easily access AWS resources, potentially
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each user account to verify that MFA is enabled. This can be done by reviewing
      the "Security Credentials" tab for each user and ensuring that an MFA device
      is assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user account that needs MFA enabled.
    - Go to the "Security Credentials" tab and assign an MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to configure the MFA device, ensuring it is activated
      and tested.
