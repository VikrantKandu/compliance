  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, making
      it crucial to ensure they are only accessible to authorized users.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket. 4. Ensure the
      "Block all public access" setting is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the ACL does not grant
      public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check for policies allowing public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket
      settings. 4. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access. 5.
      Use the AWS CLI or console to verify the changes have been applied.
