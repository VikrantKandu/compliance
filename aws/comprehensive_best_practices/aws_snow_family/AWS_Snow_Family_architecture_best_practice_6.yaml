  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access should be restricted to
      protect sensitive data stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps
      in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket. 4. Go to the Permissions tab. 5. Check the Block public
      access settings and ensure that all options are enabled. 6. Verify that the
      bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the policy JSON. 7.
      Confirm that no bucket ACLs grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable block public access settings for the bucket. 2. Review
      and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
      3. Adjust bucket ACLs to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
