    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing account
      security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised accounts due to stolen
      or guessed passwords. Without MFA, unauthorized users with access to a user's
      credentials can easily gain access to AWS resources, potentially leading to
      data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check each IAM user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users who have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select the user.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' and then 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure MFA for the user.
