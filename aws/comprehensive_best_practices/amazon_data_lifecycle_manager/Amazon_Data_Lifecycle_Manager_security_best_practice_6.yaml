    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication in addition
      to a password. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
      If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access to a user's password could
      potentially access your AWS environment and perform malicious actions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
      6. In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Assign MFA device'.
      7. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
