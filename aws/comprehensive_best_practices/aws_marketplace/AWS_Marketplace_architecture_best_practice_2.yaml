  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring an additional factor beyond just a username
      and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
  - Rationale: Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data breaches or resource misuse.
      Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring an additional
      authentication factor.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user to verify if
      MFA is enabled. 5. Check the 'Security credentials' tab for each user to ensure
      MFA is activated.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage
      MFA device'. 6. Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to
      the user.
