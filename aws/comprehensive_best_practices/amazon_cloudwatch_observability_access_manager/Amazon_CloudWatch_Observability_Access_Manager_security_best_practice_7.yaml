    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance the security of user accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources by requiring a second form of authentication. Without MFA,
      user accounts are more susceptible to phishing attacks, credential theft, and
      other forms of unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the MFA column
      to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      authentication section, choose Manage MFA. 7. Follow the instructions to assign
      a virtual MFA device, U2F security key, or hardware MFA device to the user.
