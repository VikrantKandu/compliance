  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leakage. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps protect sensitive data
      from being exposed on the internet.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify that no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL for each S3 bucket.
    - Remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to buckets and
      objects.
