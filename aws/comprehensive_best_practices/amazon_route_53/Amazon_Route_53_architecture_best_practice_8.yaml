    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is crucial to configure
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of exposing data to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the "Access" column for any buckets marked
      as "Public."
    - For each public bucket, inspect the bucket policy and ACL settings to identify
      public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access must be explicitly
      granted.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the publicly accessible bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
