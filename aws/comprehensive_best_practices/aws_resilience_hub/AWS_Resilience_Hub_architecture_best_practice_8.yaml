    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second
      form of authentication, such as a code from a mobile app or a hardware token,
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access, especially in cases where a user's password is compromised. Without
      MFA, an attacker could gain full access to AWS resources, potentially leading
      to data breaches, unauthorized resource usage, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users without MFA enabled.
