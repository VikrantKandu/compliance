    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. It is crucial to protect
      data stored in S3 by restricting public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. By restricting public access, you minimize the risk of exposing
      sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and check for any
        'AllUsers' or 'AuthenticatedUsers' entries.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review bucket policies and remove any policies that allow public access.
