    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves checking bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the "Public access" status for each
      bucket.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and
      review the "Block public access" settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for each bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements that allow
      public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      specific users or roles.
