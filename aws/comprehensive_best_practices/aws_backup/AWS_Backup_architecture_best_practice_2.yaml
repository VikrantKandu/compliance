    Title: Ensure IAM policies are attached to groups or roles instead of directly
      to users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      users but are instead attached to groups or roles. This practice promotes better
      access management and simplifies policy management.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex access management
      and potential security risks. By using groups or roles, access permissions can
      be managed more efficiently, reducing the risk of excessive permissions and
      improving security posture.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM policies and check their attachment status.
    - Verify that policies are not directly attached to individual users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups,
      or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any policies directly attached to users.
    - Detach these policies from users.
    - Attach the policies to appropriate groups or roles that the users belong to.
