    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for AWS accounts by requiring users to enter a unique authentication code from
      a device in addition to their password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA prevents unauthorized access to AWS accounts, which can
      lead to data breaches, unauthorized changes, and other security incidents. Without
      MFA, compromised credentials can be easily exploited.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - Choose a user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable MFA.
    - Repeat for each user without MFA enabled.
