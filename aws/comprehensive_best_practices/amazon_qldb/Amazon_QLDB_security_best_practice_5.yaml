    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password but also a second form
      of verification to access the account. This check ensures that MFA is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts even if the password is compromised. Without MFA, attackers
      can gain access to sensitive resources and data, potentially leading to data
      breaches and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, ensure that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify MFA configuration for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate and assign an MFA device for the user.
