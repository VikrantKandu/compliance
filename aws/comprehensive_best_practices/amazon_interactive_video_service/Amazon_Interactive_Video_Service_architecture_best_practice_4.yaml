    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to the data stored within them. This
      is crucial to protect sensitive information from being publicly accessible.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of accidental exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public read or write access.
    - Verify that the bucket is not listed as publicly accessible in the S3 console.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure public access is blocked
      at the account and bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and access controls to maintain compliance.
