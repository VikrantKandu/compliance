    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users with console access have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA enhances the security of user sign-in by requiring an additional
      verification factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible
      to phishing attacks and other security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure that the user successfully configures and tests the MFA device.
