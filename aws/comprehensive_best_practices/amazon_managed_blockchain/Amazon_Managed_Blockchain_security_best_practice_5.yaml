    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Restricting public access is essential to protect sensitive information
      and adhere to compliance requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or access control
      lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify the ACL settings
      for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review and update permissions to ensure compliance.
