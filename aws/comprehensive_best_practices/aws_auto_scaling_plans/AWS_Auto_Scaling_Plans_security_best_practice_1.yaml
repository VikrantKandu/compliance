  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the access permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
