    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
