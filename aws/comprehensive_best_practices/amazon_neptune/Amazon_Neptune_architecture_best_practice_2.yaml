    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps maintain data privacy
      and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is restricted.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public permissions.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block public access" on the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to grant access only to
      authorized users.
