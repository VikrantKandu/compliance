    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and edit the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
