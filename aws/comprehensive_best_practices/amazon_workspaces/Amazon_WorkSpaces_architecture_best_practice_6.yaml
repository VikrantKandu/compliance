    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be restricted unless explicitly required and justified.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting bucket access
      minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with public access settings.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      that public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings programmatically.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - For any bucket with public access, remove public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to apply the necessary changes and
      ensure compliance.
