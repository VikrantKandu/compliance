    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional verification step during
      login.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could
      lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA
      devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user and choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)", click "Manage" and follow the instructions
      to assign an MFA device.
    - Ensure all IAM users have MFA enabled.
