    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets
      should be private, and access should be restricted to specific users or roles.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that no bucket
      has a public access policy or ACLs granting public access. 5. Alternatively,
      use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket permissions and check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Remove any public access policies
      or ACLs. 5. Enable bucket policies that restrict access to specific users or
      roles. 6. Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
