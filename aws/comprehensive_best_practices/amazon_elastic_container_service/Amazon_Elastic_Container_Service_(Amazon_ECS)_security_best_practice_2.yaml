    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      privacy and security. Public access can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      leading to potential data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use AWS Config or AWS IAM Access Analyzer to detect public access configurations.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
