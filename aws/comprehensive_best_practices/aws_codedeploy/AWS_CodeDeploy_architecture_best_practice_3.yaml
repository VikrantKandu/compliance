    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security to the AWS environment by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication. This practice helps to prevent
      unauthorized access even if a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of account compromise due
      to stolen credentials. Without MFA, users are more vulnerable to phishing attacks
      and other credential-stealing tactics.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if the 'MFA device' is assigned.
    - Ensure that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select a user and choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
