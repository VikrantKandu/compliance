  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security. MFA provides an additional layer of protection
      on top of the username and password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks such as phishing and credential theft.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Assigned
      MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device
      to the user.
