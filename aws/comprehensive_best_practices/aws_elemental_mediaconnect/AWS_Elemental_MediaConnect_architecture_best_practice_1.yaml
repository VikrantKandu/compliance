    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Do Not Have Public IPs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not assigned public IP
      addresses, which can expose them to the internet and potential security risks.
    Rationale: Assigning public IP addresses to EC2 instances can lead to unauthorized
      access and security breaches. Limiting public IPs reduces the attack surface
      and enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: Review the list of instances and check the 'Public IP' column.
    - Step 5: Verify that no instances have a public IP assigned.
    Default Value: By default, instances launched in a default VPC are assigned a
      public IP address.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances with public IPs.
    - Step 2: Modify the instance settings to remove the public IP.
    - Step 3: Consider using a NAT Gateway or Bastion Host for necessary internet
        access.
