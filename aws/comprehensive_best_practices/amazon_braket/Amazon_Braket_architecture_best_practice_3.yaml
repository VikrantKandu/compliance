    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data is
      encrypted automatically when stored in AWS. This helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and complies with various data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify if "Default encryption" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption and check
      for the presence of a server-side encryption configuration.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption" with the desired
      encryption method.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption to enable
      encryption programmatically.
