    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access Management
      (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security to user sign-in processes. MFA
      requires users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their
      password, which helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of user accounts by requiring additional
      verification beyond just a password. This reduces the risk of compromised accounts,
      especially in cases where passwords may be weak or exposed through phishing
      attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
