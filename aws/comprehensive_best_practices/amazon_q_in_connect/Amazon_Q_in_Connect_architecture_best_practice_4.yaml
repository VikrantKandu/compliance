    Title: Ensure IAM users have MFA enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of verification, such as a code from a mobile app, in
      addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users mitigates the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's password
      can access AWS resources and potentially cause harm or data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list all IAM users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing their MFA device configuration.
    - Confirm that each user has an assigned MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage MFA device" and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to
      the user.
