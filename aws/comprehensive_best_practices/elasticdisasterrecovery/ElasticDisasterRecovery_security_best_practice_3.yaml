    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed
      by anyone on the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial as it mitigates the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to sensitive data being accessed or modified by malicious actors.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Check the 'Block public
      access (bucket settings)' section to ensure all options are enabled. 5. Verify
      that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console and select the affected bucket. 2. Click
      on the 'Permissions' tab. 3. Enable 'Block all public access' by checking all
      options. 4. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
