    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps maintain data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
