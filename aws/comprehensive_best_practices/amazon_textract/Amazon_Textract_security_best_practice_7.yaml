    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to
      data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality, reducing the risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have Block Public Access enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      specific users or roles.
