    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS accounts. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible to unauthorized access through
      compromised credentials. MFA adds an additional verification step, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the "MFA" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all MFA devices and verify their status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, click "Manage" and follow
      the steps to assign an MFA device.
