    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Using the default security group can lead to unintended
      access permissions.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can expose instances to security vulnerabilities. Ensuring instances are
      not using the default security group helps enforce more granular access control.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may use the default security group if not explicitly
      specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your needs.
    - Assign the new security group to the instances.
    - Remove the default security group association from those instances.
