  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow all inbound traffic from
      instances assigned to the same security group, which can pose security risks.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      instances to each other, increasing the risk of lateral movement in case of
      a security breach. Custom security groups should be used to enforce least privilege
      access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Click on "Instances" in the left navigation pane. 4. For each instance, check
      the associated security groups. 5. Ensure no instance is using the default security
      group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group if
      no other security group is specified at launch.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored to the
      application's needs. 3. Detach the default security group from the instance
      and attach the newly created security group.
