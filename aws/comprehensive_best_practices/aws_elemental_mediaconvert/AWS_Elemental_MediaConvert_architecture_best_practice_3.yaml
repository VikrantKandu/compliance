    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security
      to their accounts. MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors
      to gain access, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances security by requiring
      additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, user accounts are
      more susceptible to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized actions within your AWS environment.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check if an MFA device
      is assigned by reviewing the MFA column. 5. Verify that all users have an MFA
      device enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      authentication section, choose Assign MFA device. 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      and activate the MFA device.
