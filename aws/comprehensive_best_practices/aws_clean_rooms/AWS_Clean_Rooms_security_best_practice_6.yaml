    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using EBS-optimized instances
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should be configured to use EBS-optimized instances
      to ensure that they provide dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon
      EBS. This configuration helps to achieve the best performance for EBS volumes
      attached to EC2 instances.
    Rationale: Using EBS-optimized instances ensures that EC2 instances have dedicated
      bandwidth for EBS I/O operations, which reduces latency and improves the performance
      of attached EBS volumes. Not using EBS-optimized instances can lead to performance
      bottlenecks, particularly for applications with high I/O requirements.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. For each running instance, check
      the instance type to see if it supports EBS optimization. 5. Verify that EBS
      optimization is enabled for each instance.
    Default Value: Not all instance types are EBS-optimized by default. It depends
      on the instance type and configuration.
    Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances that are not EBS-optimized. 2. Stop the
      instance if necessary. 3. Modify the instance to enable EBS optimization. 4.
      Start the instance again to apply changes.
