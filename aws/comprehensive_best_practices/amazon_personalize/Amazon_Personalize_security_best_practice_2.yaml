    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. This involves checking bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically review bucket settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
