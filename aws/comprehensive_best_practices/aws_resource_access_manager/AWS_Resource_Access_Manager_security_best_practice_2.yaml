    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Buckets should have policies that restrict public
      access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Restricting public access mitigates
      this risk and ensures data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket from the AWS Management Console
      under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce least privilege access.
