    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose confidential data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored within them. This
      can result in data leaks, compliance violations, and financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Public' access status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any bucket policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to remove public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Consider enabling the 'Block Public Access' setting for the bucket.
