    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data and comply with privacy
      regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the permissions tab. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy
      does not grant public access. 5. Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to
      ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not grant public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket in question. 3. Go to the permissions tab and edit the bucket policy
      to remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable 'Block Public Access' settings
      for the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
