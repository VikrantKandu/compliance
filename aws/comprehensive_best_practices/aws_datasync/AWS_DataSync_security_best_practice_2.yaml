    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets poses a significant security risk as it
      can lead to unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access settings for the
      bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
