    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in All Regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to provide a
      comprehensive log of all account activity across AWS infrastructure.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions helps ensure that all actions taken
      by users, roles, or AWS services are recorded. This is crucial for security
      analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. Without enabling
      CloudTrail, there is a risk of missing critical event logs that could aid in
      detecting unauthorized access or anomalies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to CloudTrail service.
    - Check if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions.
    - Verify that the trails are logging to an S3 bucket and that log file validation
      is enabled.
    - Ensure that the trails are configured to send logs to CloudWatch Logs.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or edit an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Ensure the trail is logging to an S3 bucket and enable log file validation.
    - Configure the trail to send logs to CloudWatch Logs for monitoring and alerting
      purposes.
