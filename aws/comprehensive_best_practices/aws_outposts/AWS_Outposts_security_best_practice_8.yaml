    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized exposure of sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions and public access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and aws s3api
        get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
