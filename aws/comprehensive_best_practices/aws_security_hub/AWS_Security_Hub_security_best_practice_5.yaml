    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to maintaining data
      privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, resulting in data leaks or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service dashboard.
    - Review the bucket settings for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the "Block all public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they
      do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access, and it must
      be explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service dashboard.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
