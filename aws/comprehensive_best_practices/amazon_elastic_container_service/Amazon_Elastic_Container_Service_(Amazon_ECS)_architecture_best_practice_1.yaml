  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance types
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest generation
      instance types. Using the latest generation instances can provide better performance,
      cost efficiency, and security features.
  - Rationale: The latest generation instance types are designed to offer improved
      performance, energy efficiency, and enhanced security features. Older instance
      types may lack the latest optimizations and security enhancements, potentially
      leading to increased costs and vulnerabilities.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all EC2 instances and their instance types.
    - Verify that the instance types are the latest generation available.
  - Default Value: EC2 instances may be launched with older generation instance types
      by default.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances that are not using the latest generation instance types.
    - Plan for a migration to the latest instance types by evaluating compatibility
      and performance requirements.
    - Stop the instance, change the instance type to the latest generation, and restart
      the instance.
