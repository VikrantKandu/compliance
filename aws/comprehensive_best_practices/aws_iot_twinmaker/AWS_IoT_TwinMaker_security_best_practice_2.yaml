    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from being accessed by unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data leaks, unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      only authorized users and roles.
