    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS accounts to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to an account,
      significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of AWS accounts by requiring additional
      verification steps beyond just a username and password. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches
      and loss of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review each user account to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      verify the MFA status for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for AWS accounts.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user account for which you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)', click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up and activate MFA.
