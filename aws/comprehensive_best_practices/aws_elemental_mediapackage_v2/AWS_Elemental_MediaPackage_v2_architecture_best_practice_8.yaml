    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance issues.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data breaches and helps maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not grant public access. 5. Utilize the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket
      ACLs. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Edit the bucket policy
      to remove any public access permissions. 5. Adjust the ACL to remove any public
      access grants. 6. Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional
      protection.
