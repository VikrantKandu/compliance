    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can expose sensitive information and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure that all public access is blocked for the bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no ACL grants public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
