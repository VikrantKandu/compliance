    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in an AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide both a password and an additional form of verification, such
      as a temporary code generated by a hardware device or a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker
      would still need the MFA device or code to access the account. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, credential stuffing,
      and brute force.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM Dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with and without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
