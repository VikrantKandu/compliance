    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data leaks, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. It is crucial to restrict public access to
      protect sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access.
