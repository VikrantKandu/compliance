  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Groups
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to potential
      unauthorized access and attacks, as it allows unrestricted inbound and outbound
      traffic. Ensuring instances are associated with custom security groups with
      specific rules helps minimize security risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      security group associated with it. 5. Verify that none of the instances are
      using the default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify the instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that adhere to
      your security policies. 3. Associate the new security group with the instances
      currently using the default security group. 4. Remove the default security group
      from the instances.
