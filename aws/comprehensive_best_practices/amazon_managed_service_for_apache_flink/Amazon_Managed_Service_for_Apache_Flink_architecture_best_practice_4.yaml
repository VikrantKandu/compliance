    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to significant security risks,
      including unauthorized data access and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible protects sensitive data from being exposed to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to control access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket settings and permissions to ensure compliance.
