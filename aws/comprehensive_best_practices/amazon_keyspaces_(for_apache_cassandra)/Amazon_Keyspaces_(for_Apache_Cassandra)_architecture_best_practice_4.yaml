    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Public access can lead to data breaches
      and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data. This can lead to data
      leaks, unauthorized access, and potential data manipulation.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy
      and Access Control List (ACL) do not grant public access. 5. Verify that the
      "Block public access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and review
      the bucket policy and ACL. 4. Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any
      public access permissions. 5. Enable "Block public access" settings for the
      bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
