    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to user
      accounts by requiring a second form of verification. This helps prevent unauthorized
      access in case of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized account
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      full access to the account. MFA requires an additional verification step, making
      it more challenging for unauthorized users to gain access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
