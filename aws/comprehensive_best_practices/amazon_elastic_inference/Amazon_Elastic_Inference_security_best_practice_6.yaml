    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure that no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
