    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches or data leaks.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure.
      Unintended public access can lead to sensitive data being exposed to the internet,
      which can be exploited by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets
      marked as 'Public'.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure that public access is blocked
      for all buckets.
    - Alternatively, run the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the bucket's ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Apply changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
