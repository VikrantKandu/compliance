    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data
      from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that all public access options are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be altered
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to remove
      any public access permissions.
