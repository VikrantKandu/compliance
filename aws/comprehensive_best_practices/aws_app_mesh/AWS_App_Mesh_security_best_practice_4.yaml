    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves setting bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) to deny public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as sensitive
      information may be exposed to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to confirm there are no public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are set to private, but users may change
      these settings.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure no public access is
      granted.
