    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on
      top of a username and password by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, as it requires a second factor of authentication which
      is harder to compromise. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing
      attacks and credential theft.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user and check the
      'Security credentials' tab. 5. Verify that 'Assigned MFA device' is listed for
      each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user to
      enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the on-screen instructions
      to assign an MFA device to the user.
