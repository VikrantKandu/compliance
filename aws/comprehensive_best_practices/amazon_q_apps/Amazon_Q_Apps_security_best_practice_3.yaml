    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to incorporate the latest security patches
      and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer versions. Ensuring the use of the latest AMIs helps
      maintain security and compliance by reducing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - For each running instance, verify the AMI ID and check if it corresponds to
      the latest version available in the AWS Marketplace or your custom AMI catalog.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to list instances and their AMIs, then compare
      against the latest available AMI IDs.
    Default Value: By default, instances may be launched with any available AMI, including
      outdated ones.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running outdated AMIs.
    - Schedule a maintenance window to update or replace these instances with new
      ones using the latest AMI.
    - Consider automating the AMI update process using AWS Systems Manager or other
      orchestration tools to ensure ongoing compliance.
