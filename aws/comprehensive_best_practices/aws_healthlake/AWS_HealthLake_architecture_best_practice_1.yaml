    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within.
    Rationale: S3 buckets set to public can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access settings.
    - Ensure that each bucket's permissions are set to private and do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but configurations can
      be altered.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and locate the bucket with public access.
    - Edit the bucket permissions to remove public access.
    - Implement bucket policies or ACLs to restrict access to authorized users only.
