    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible minimizes the risk of
      data leakage and helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      and bucket level.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for the bucket.
    - Review and modify any IAM policies that grant public access to the bucket.
