    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, increasing the security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access. If the root account credentials are compromised, MFA provides an additional
      barrier, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to critical resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to see if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the command 'aws iam get-account-summary'
      and check the 'AccountMFAEnabled' field.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Verify the MFA device to complete the setup.
