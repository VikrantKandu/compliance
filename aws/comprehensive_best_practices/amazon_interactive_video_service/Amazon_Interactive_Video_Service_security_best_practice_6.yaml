    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk
      of compromised credentials and unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      full access to the user's permissions. MFA requires a second factor, making
      unauthorized access significantly more difficult.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if the "MFA device" is assigned.
    - Verify that all IAM users have an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," choose "Manage" and follow the steps to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
