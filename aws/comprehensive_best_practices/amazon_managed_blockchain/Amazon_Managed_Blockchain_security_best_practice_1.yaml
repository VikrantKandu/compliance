    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched with the latest
      Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose your instances to vulnerabilities that
      have been addressed in newer versions. Regularly updating AMIs helps maintain
      security and stability.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the AMI ID of each running instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the specific operating
      system.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified
      during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance to ensure all resources are up-to-date.
