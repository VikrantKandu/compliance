    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose significant security risks, including
      unauthorized data access, data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket is
      not publicly accessible.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check the
        ACL permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
        the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging for additional security measures.
