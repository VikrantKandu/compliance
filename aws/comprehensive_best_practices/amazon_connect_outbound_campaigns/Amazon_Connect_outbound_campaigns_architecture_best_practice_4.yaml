    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if credentials are compromised, an attacker can easily
      gain access to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      an additional form of verification.
    Audit: Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list IAM users and check if
      MFA is enabled. Use the command 'aws iam list-users' to get all users, then
      'aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>' to check for each user if
      MFA devices are configured.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: To remediate, use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to enable
      MFA for each IAM user. In the console, navigate to the IAM user, choose the
      'Security credentials' tab, and follow the steps to assign an MFA device. Alternatively,
      use 'aws iam enable-mfa-device' command to enable MFA via CLI.
