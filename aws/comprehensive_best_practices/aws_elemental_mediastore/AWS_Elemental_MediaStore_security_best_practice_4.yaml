    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect sensitive data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets helps protect data from unauthorized
      access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to exposure in the event of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and click on "Default encryption."
    - Choose an encryption option (e.g., Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key
      Management Service (SSE-KMS)).
    - Save changes to enable encryption.
