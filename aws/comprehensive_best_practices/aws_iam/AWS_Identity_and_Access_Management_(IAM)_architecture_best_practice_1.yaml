    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for any public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any bucket with public access, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy or ACLs.
