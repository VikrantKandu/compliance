    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound access,
      which can expose the instance to potential security threats.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to security vulnerabilities
      as it allows inbound traffic from any source. This can result in unauthorized
      access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and identify instances using the default security group.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with a security group that allows unrestricted
      access.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are automatically associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and select 'Instances'.
    - For each instance using the default security group, select 'Networking' and
      then 'Change Security Groups'.
    - Assign a custom security group with restrictive inbound rules to the instance.
