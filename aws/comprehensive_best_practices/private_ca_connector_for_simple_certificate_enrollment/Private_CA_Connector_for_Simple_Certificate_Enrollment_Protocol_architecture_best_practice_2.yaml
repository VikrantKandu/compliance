    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private and that
      server-side encryption is enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: S3 buckets by default can be accessible to the public, which may lead
      to unauthorized access and data breaches. Enabling encryption ensures that data
      is protected from unauthorized access even if it is accessed.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure the bucket is not
        publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Verify that server-side encryption is enabled by checking the properties
        tab of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but encryption is not enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy and access
        control list (ACL) to restrict public access.
    - Step 2: Enable server-side encryption for each bucket by navigating to the properties
        tab and selecting the appropriate encryption option.
