    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets are private. Publicly accessible buckets pose
      a significant security risk as they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access'
        settings are enabled for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they
        do not grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Step 4: Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access
        permissions.
