    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to data loss or leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you wish to audit.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
