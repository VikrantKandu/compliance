    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA enhances security
      by requiring an additional factor beyond just a password for authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure. It helps
      protect against unauthorized access to AWS resources, even if an IAM user's
      password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks
      such as phishing and credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on a user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage' and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA.
    - Repeat the process for each IAM user.
