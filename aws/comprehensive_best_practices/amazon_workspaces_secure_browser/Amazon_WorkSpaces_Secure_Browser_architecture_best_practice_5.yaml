    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the
      risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the Access column in the bucket list. 4. Ensure that
      no bucket is listed as 'Public'. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name" to list all buckets and then aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> for each bucket to verify the ACL
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab.
      5. Adjust the bucket policy or ACL to remove public access. 6. Enable Block
      Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
