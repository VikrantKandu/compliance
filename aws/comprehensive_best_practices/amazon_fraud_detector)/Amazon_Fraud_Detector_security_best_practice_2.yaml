  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
      It is crucial to restrict access to only authorized users and applications.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and
      integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for
      public access settings. 4. Verify that the "Block all public access" setting
      is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the policy status programmatically.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked, but existing
      buckets may not have this setting.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all public access" and save
      changes. 5. Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      access permissions.
