    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS account by requiring users to provide additional verification beyond
      their username and password. This helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users mitigates the risk of compromised credentials,
      reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA,
      users are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and other security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
