  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of
      security to your AWS accounts by requiring not only a password and username
      but also something that only the user has access to, such as a physical device.
  - Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      If a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker would still need access
      to the MFA device to gain entry, thereby protecting sensitive resources and
      data.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA device'
      column to verify that MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user to enable
      MFA for. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
