    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage, unauthorized
      access, and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant
        public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDK to run the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
        --bucket <bucket-name> and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Step 5: Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access at
        the account level.
    - Step 6: Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
        policies.
