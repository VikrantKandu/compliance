    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that all S3 buckets are configured to be private and that
      server-side encryption is enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private and encrypted prevents unauthorized access
      and ensures data security. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches,
      and unencrypted data is vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the permissions tab for each bucket
      to ensure they are not publicly accessible. 4. Verify that server-side encryption
      is enabled for each bucket by checking the properties tab.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private but not encrypted.
    Remediation: 1. For each bucket that is publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy or ACL to remove public access. 2. Enable server-side encryption by setting
      the default encryption configuration for each bucket.
