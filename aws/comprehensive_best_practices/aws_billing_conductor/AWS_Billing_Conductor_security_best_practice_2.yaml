    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA helps protect user credentials by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials by requiring
      a second factor for authentication. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's
      password can gain full access to the account, leading to potential data breaches
      and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select a user without MFA enabled. 4. Choose the 'Security credentials'
      tab. 5. In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'. 6. Follow the
      prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
