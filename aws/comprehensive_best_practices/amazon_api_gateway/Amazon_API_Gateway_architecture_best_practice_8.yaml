    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for the AWS root account to provide an
      additional layer of security. This practice helps prevent unauthorized access
      to the account in case the root password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second
      form of authentication. Without MFA, the root account is more vulnerable to
      unauthorized access, which could lead to account compromise and potential data
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account settings.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Enable MFA for the root account by following the on-screen instructions to configure
      a virtual or hardware MFA device.
