    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that all four options are enabled to block public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access."
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
