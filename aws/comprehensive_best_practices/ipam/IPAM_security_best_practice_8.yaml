    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms of identification before
      gaining access, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts by adding an
      additional authentication layer, making it more difficult for attackers to gain
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify the 'MFA device' column to ensure an MFA device is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        to list users and their MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device to
      the user.
