  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the
      buckets.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized data
      exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive
      information, and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not
        allow public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically check the bucket permissions
        for public access settings.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Modify the bucket policy or ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Step 5: Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access
        can be granted.
