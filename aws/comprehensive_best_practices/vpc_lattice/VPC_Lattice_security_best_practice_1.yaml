    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect data
      from being exposed to the internet. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to access, modify, or delete data, leading to potential data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to grant specific
      access to users or roles as needed.
