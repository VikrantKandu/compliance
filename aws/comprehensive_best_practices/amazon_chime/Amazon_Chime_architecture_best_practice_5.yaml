    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      resulting in potential data breaches and non-compliance with data protection
      regulations. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access
      settings. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings for public access. 5. Verify that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
      2. Implement bucket policies that deny public access. 3. Enable S3 Block Public
      Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
