    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual
      Private Cloud (VPC). Launching instances within a VPC provides enhanced security
      features and control over network configurations.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in a VPC provides additional security and management
      capabilities, such as security groups, network ACLs, and subnets. This reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access and enhances the security posture of the AWS
      environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - Verify that all listed instances have a VPC ID associated with them.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC if no
      specific VPC is chosen.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances not in a VPC.
    - Plan and create a VPC with necessary subnets, route tables, and security groups.
    - Migrate the identified instances into the newly created VPC, ensuring minimal
      downtime and proper configuration.
