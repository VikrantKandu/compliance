    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      private by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent any future public
      access configurations.
