    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and potential data loss.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the public
      internet, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check bucket ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and remove any public bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
