    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer
      of protection on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended to protect AWS accounts from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks
      and unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and potential financial
      loss.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
