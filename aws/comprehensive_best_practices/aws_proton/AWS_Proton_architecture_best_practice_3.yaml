    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide a
      second form of authentication, enhancing the security of user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, the
      attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA acts as a strong
      deterrent against such attacks.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console. 3. In
      the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security credentials'
      tab. 5. Verify that the 'Assigned MFA device' is set for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the 'Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the prompts
      to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
