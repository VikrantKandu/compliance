  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      by default. Public access to S3 buckets should be explicitly enabled only when
      necessary to minimize unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of accidental exposure of data.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public read or write access
      unless explicitly required. 5. Verify that the Block Public Access settings
      are enabled for the account and each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access must be explicitly
      granted.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Remove any public access
      permissions from the bucket policy and ACL. 5. Enable Block Public Access settings
      for the bucket. 6. Review and update bucket policies to ensure they do not allow
      public access.
