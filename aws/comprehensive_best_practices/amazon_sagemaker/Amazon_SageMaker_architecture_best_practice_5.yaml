    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet and pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By restricting public access, you minimize
      the risk of data exposure and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for public indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its details.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and check the Block public access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have any public access permissions unless required.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Click on Edit under Block public access settings.
    - Ensure that all options to block public access are enabled.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
