  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect sensitive data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption ensures
      that data is automatically encrypted when stored in S3, providing an additional
      layer of security.
  - Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption in S3 helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data
      stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access and exposure, especially if
      access controls are misconfigured.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the properties to verify if server-side encryption
      is enabled. 4. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check encryption status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the 'Properties' tab and under 'Default Encryption',
      choose 'Enable'. 4. Select the desired encryption method (e.g., Amazon S3-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)). 5. Save the changes
      to enable server-side encryption for the bucket.
