    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive information
      and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block public access" settings.
    - Ensure that all options to block public access are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access".
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure they do not allow public
      access. Adjust as necessary to restrict access.
