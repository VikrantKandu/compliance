  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. S3 buckets should have appropriate access
      controls to protect sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use the S3 Block
      Public Access feature to block public access at the bucket and account level.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review and modify
      the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access. 2. Enable S3 Block Public Access
      for the bucket. 3. Regularly review bucket permissions and audit logs to ensure
      compliance.
