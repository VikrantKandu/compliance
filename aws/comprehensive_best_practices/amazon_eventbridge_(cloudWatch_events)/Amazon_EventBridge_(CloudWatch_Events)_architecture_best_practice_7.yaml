  - ID: AWS-IAM-001
  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled. MFA adds
      an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is critical in protecting AWS accounts from
      unauthorized access. If MFA is not enabled, there is a higher risk of account
      compromise due to phishing or stolen credentials.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Check each user to verify if MFA
      is enabled by viewing the "MFA" column. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list all MFA devices and verify their association
      with IAM users.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select a user and choose the "Security
      credentials" tab. 5. Under "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)", choose "Manage"
      and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
