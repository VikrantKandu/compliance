    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Restricting access helps safeguard data integrity and
      confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
