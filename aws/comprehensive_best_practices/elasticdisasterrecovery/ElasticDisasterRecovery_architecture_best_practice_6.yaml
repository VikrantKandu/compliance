    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet, potentially leading to data
      leaks or unauthorized data manipulation. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain privacy and security.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that the bucket
      does not have any public access permissions or policies. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      or SDK to run the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      for each bucket to confirm no public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Review and remove any public
      access permissions or policies. 5. Implement bucket policies or access control
      lists (ACLs) that restrict access to specific users or services.
