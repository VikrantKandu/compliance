  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks, compliance violations, and reputational damage. Ensuring
      buckets are not public helps protect data and maintain privacy.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy does not grant public read or write access. 5. Verify that the bucket
      ACLs do not allow public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket ACLs. 7. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not allowed
      unless explicitly configured.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove the public
      access by updating the bucket policy and ACLs. 2. Use the AWS Management Console
      or CLI to remove any public access permissions. 3. Implement S3 Block Public
      Access settings to prevent future public exposure. 4. Regularly review bucket
      permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
