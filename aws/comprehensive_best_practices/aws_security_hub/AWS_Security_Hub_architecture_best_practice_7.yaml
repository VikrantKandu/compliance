    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to unauthorized access, data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that buckets are private mitigates these risks by restricting access to authorized
      users only.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Verify the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket. 2. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
