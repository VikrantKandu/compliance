    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional authentication
      factors beyond just a password. This ensures that even if a password is compromised,
      unauthorized access is still prevented.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
      Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's password can potentially
      access sensitive data and resources, leading to data breaches and other security
      incidents.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS
      CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the
      prompts to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
