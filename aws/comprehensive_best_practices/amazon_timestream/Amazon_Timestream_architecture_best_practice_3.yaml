    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in
      addition to their password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access in
      case of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure. It helps
      protect sensitive resources and data from unauthorized access. Without MFA,
      compromised credentials can lead to data breaches and unauthorized activities
      within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Review the MFA column to ensure that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list all users
        and aws iam get-login-profile --user-name <username> to check MFA status for
        each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the Security credentials tab, choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Ensure that the user successfully configures their MFA device.
