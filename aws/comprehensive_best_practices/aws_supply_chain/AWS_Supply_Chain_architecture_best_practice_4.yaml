    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access permissions enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable any public access settings and remove any bucket policies that allow
      public access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
