    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could expose sensitive data to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Restricting public access helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings and bucket policy to ensure no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and review bucket policies to remove any public
      access permissions.
