  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Block Public Access
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have public access blocked
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Blocking public access at
      the bucket level provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that data
      is not inadvertently exposed to the public internet.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and potential compliance violations. Blocking public access reduces
      the risk of accidental data exposure and enhances data security.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure that all four options under 'Block public access' are enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      allowed by the user.
  - Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
