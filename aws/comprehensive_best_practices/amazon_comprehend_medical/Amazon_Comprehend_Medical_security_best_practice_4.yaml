    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance account security by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible to unauthorized access,
      which could lead to data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - For each user, check the "Security Credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - For each user, click on the "Security Credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" next to the "Assigned MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
