    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) that
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
