    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to unauthorized
      access, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of exposing
      sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      data manipulation, which can have severe compliance and security implications.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled or verify that bucket policies
      and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket you wish to modify.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" or adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict
      public access.
