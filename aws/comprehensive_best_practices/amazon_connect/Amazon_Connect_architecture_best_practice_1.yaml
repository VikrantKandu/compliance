    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      users, but instead are attached to groups or roles. This best practice helps
      manage permissions more effectively and reduces the risk of privilege escalation.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to difficulty in managing
      permissions and increases the risk of excessive permissions being granted. Using
      groups or roles allows for more organized and scalable permission management,
      enhancing security and compliance.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Check the list of IAM users for any directly attached policies. 4. Verify
      that all policies are attached to groups or roles instead of individual users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups,
      or roles.
    Remediation: 1. Identify any IAM users with directly attached policies. 2. Create
      or use existing IAM groups or roles with the required policies. 3. Detach the
      policies from the users and attach them to the appropriate groups or roles.
      4. Add the users to the groups or assign the roles as necessary.
