    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users
      to protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who
      obtains a user's credentials can gain full access to the account, potentially
      leading to data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify that 'MFA' is enabled under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and go to the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
