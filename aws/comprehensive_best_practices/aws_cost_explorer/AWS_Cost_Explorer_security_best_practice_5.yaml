    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of identification
      beyond their password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is exposed, an attacker could
      gain full access to AWS resources. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring an additional
      verification step.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each IAM user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with and without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select the user.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, select "Manage" for the "Assigned MFA
      device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
