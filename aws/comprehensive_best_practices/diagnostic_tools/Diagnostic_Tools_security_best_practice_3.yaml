    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling default encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data
      stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if access controls
      are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the 'Default encryption' settings.
    - Ensure that the encryption is set to either AWS-KMS or AES-256.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Click on 'Properties' and navigate to 'Default encryption'.
    - Enable encryption by selecting either AWS-KMS or AES-256.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
