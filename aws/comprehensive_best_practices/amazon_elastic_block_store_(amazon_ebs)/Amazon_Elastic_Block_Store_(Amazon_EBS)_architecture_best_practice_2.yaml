    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification beyond
      just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the account and its resources. MFA significantly reduces
      this risk by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
      to check the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
