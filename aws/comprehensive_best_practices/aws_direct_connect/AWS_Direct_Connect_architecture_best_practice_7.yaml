    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access to
      S3 buckets should be restricted unless explicitly required for specific use
      cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible minimizes
      the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that
      public access is not allowed.
    - Check the bucket policy to verify it does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to programmatically check the
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to verify the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and adjust the ACL settings to remove public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the ACL and bucket policy to restrict public access.
