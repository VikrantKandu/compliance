    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      when logging into AWS environments. It requires users to provide a second form
      of identification to access resources, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      resource usage, and potential financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure MFA is enabled by verifying that the 'MFA Device'
      column is not empty.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable MFA.
