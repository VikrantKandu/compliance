    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public accessibility should
      be restricted to prevent data breaches and comply with security best practices.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. This check helps mitigate risks associated with data leaks and ensures
      compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy does not allow public access by using aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from the S3 bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to enforce restrictions.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
