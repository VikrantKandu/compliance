    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not configured to allow public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public
      access permissions granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL configuration.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Review and update the bucket's permissions to ensure only authorized users have
      access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
