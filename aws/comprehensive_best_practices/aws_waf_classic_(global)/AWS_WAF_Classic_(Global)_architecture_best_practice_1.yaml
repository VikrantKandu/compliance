    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a secondary form of authentication. This reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the MFA column for each user in the IAM user list.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select an IAM user.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
