    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Monitored
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: AWS CloudFormation should be monitored to ensure that stack resources
      are created, updated, and deleted according to the defined templates. Monitoring
      helps to detect unauthorized changes and ensure compliance with organizational
      policies.
    Rationale: Monitoring CloudFormation stacks helps to maintain the integrity of
      infrastructure as code by ensuring that changes are intentional and authorized.
      It reduces the risk of configuration drift and unauthorized modifications, which
      can lead to security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, and operational
      issues.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Check the stack events and ensure that all changes are logged and
      monitored. 4. Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to log API calls related to
      CloudFormation. 5. Ensure that Amazon CloudWatch alarms are configured for critical
      stack changes.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation does not automatically enable detailed
      monitoring or logging.
    Remediation: 1. Enable AWS CloudTrail to record API calls and changes to CloudFormation
      stacks. 2. Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms to monitor stack changes and notify
      relevant personnel. 3. Regularly review stack events and logs to ensure that
      all changes are authorized and compliant with policies.
