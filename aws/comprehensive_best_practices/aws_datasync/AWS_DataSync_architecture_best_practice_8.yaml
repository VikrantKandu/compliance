  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive data. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality
      and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leakage and non-compliance
      with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block
      public access" settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Verify that
      no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket you want to modify. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable
      "Block all public access" settings. 5. Review and modify bucket policies and
      ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
