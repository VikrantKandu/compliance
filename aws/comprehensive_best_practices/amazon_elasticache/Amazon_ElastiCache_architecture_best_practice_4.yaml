    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring
      buckets are private helps protect sensitive information and complies with data
      protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and public access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public read or write permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for public policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
