    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      is critical for maintaining data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    - Verify that no bucket policy allows public access by using the command aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab of the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Ensure IAM policies do not inadvertently allow public access.
