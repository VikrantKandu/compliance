    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring not only a password but also a second form of
      authentication. This helps protect against unauthorized access in case a password
      is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to password theft. Without MFA, attackers with stolen credentials
      can gain full access to AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches and
      service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Confirm that all users have MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the steps to enable
      MFA.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
