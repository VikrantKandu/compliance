    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with default
      security groups, which often allow unrestricted inbound traffic. Using custom
      security groups helps to enforce least privilege access.
    Rationale: Default security groups typically allow all inbound and outbound traffic,
      posing a security risk. By using custom security groups, you can limit access
      to necessary ports and IP ranges, reducing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using a security group with the name "default".
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that meet
      your security requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances that are using the default
      security group.
    - Remove the default security group association from the instances.
