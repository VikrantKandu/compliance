    Title: Ensure IAM users have MFA enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      a second form of authentication in addition to the password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by reducing the risk of
      compromised credentials. Without MFA, an attacker with access to a user's password
      can gain full access to the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring an
      additional factor for authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices for
        each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the specific user.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
