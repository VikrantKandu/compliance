    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading to data
      breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in unauthorized access to
      sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of data exposure
      and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that Block Public Access settings are enabled for the account and individual
      buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings at the bucket and account level.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure no public access permissions
      are granted.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
