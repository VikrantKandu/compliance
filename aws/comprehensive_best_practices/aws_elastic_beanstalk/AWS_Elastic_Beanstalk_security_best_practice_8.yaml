  - Title: Enable RDS Encryption
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon RDS instances have encryption at rest enabled
      to protect sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Encrypting RDS instances helps protect data at rest, meeting compliance
      requirements and safeguarding against unauthorized access. Without encryption,
      sensitive data may be exposed if the underlying storage is compromised.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
    - Select the RDS instance to review.
    - Check the 'Storage' section to verify if 'Encryption' is set to 'Enabled'.
  - Default Value: By default, RDS instances are not encrypted.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
    - Create a snapshot of the existing unencrypted RDS instance.
    - Copy the snapshot and enable encryption during the copy process.
    - Restore the encrypted snapshot to a new RDS instance.
    - Update applications to use the new encrypted RDS instance.
