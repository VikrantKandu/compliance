    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Ensure no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies to ensure they do not allow public access.
