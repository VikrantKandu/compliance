    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check if any Amazon S3 bucket is publicly accessible. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      data privacy and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to verify that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access.
