    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access
      to an account, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access. The root account has unrestricted access to the AWS environment, and
      if compromised, it could lead to severe security breaches, data loss, or service
      disruption. MFA provides an additional layer of security beyond just a password.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Dashboard'. 4. Under 'Security Status', check
      if 'MFA on the root account' is enabled. 5. Verify that the status indicates
      MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your root account
      credentials. 2. Navigate to the IAM service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose
      'Dashboard'. 4. Under 'Security Status', choose 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
      5. Follow the prompts to select a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device
      and complete the setup process.
