    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to be private by default to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. This check ensures that no public access
      is granted unless explicitly required and justified.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of
      accidental public exposure of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access.
