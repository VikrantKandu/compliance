    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and compliance
      violations, impacting the organization's security posture.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
