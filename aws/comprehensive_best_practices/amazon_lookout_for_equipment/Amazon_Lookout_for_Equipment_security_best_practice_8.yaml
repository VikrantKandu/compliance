    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to potential
      attacks, as it allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Restricting access to
      EC2 instances by using custom security groups helps minimize the attack surface.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      security group listed under the "Security Groups" column. 5. Verify that no
      instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group.
    Remediation: 1. Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound
      rules. 2. Disassociate the default security group from the EC2 instance. 3.
      Associate the new security group with the EC2 instance.
