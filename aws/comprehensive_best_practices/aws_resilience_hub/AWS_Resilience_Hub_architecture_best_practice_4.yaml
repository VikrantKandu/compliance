    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible prevents unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to data leaks, compliance violations,
      and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public access
      settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have any public access granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings in the S3 console to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
