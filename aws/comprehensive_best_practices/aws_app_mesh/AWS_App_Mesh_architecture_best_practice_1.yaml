  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, security, and compliance
      across the organization's infrastructure.
  - Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps ensure that instances are launched with a
      secure and consistent baseline configuration, reducing the risk of security
      vulnerabilities and configuration drift. Non-compliance can lead to instances
      with outdated or insecure software, increasing the attack surface.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - Review the AMI ID for each running instance.
    - Verify the AMI ID against the list of approved AMIs maintained by the organization.
  - Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify non-compliant EC2 instances.
    - Create a backup of the current instance state if necessary.
    - Stop the non-compliant instance.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate data and configurations from the non-compliant instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance once migration is complete.
