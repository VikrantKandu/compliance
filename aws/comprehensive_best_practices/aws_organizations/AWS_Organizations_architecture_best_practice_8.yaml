    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets should be private to protect data from unauthorized
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of
      sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes the
      risk of accidental public exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Verify that each bucket's access permissions are set to private.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL of each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
