    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and do
      not allow public access. Public buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME
      to check the bucket's ACL for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and edit the Block Public Access settings.
    - Ensure all options to block public access are enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
