    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that your Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with data protection
      regulations. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket to ensure that there are no public access
      settings.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any 'Allow' statements
      that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
