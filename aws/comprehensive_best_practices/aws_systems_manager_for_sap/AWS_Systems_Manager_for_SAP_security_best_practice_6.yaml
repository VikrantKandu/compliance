    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security
      to the AWS accounts. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms
      of identification before gaining access, thereby reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could be used
      by attackers to gain full access to an AWS account, potentially leading to data
      breaches, resource misuse, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled by ensuring that the 'MFA device'
      column is not empty.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security Credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
