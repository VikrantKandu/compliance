    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound traffic
      from the same security group, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      your instances to unnecessary network traffic, increasing the risk of unauthorized
      access or attacks. By ensuring instances use custom security groups, you can
      better control inbound and outbound traffic.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      'Security groups' column. 5. Ensure that each instance is not associated with
      the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may use the default security group
      unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored to your
      application needs. 3. Detach the default security group from the instance and
      attach the newly created security group.
