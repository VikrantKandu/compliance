    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data and lead to security breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      potentially leading to data leaks, unauthorized access, or data breaches. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for public access indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and
      review the "Block public access" settings.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" option is enabled unless there is
      a specific and documented requirement for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Click on "Edit" under the "Block public access" section.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      they do not allow public access unless necessary.
