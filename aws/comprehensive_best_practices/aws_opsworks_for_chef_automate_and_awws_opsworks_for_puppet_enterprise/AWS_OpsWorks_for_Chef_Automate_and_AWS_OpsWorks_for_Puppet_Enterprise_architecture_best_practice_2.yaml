    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker can gain full
      access to the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring a second factor,
      such as a physical device or a mobile app.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA Device" column to ensure that an MFA device is
      assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user without MFA enabled.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" next to Assigned MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
