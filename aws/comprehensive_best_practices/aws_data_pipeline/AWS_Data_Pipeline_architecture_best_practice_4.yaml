    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Default Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling default encryption helps secure sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Without default encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling encryption mitigates
      these risks by ensuring that all objects are encrypted automatically when stored.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab. 4. Check if the Default Encryption
      section is enabled. 5. Verify that a server-side encryption method (SSE-S3 or
      SSE-KMS) is selected.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have default encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs encryption. 4. Go to the Properties tab. 5.
      In the Default Encryption section, select Enable. 6. Choose the appropriate
      encryption method (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) and save changes.
