    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no buckets have public access.
      4. Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not grant public access. 5. Verify
      that the block public access settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Modify the bucket policy
      to remove any public access. 5. Enable block public access settings for the
      bucket. 6. Review and update bucket permissions to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
