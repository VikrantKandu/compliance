    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in
      addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, if a password is compromised, an attacker can gain full access
      to the account. MFA significantly reduces the risk of account compromise by
      requiring a second factor that only the user possesses.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the "Users" section for each user.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the "MFA" column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and choose the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage" under the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
