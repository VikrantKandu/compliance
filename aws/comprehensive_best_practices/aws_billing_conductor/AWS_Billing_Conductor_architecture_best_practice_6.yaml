    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it typically allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Restricting
      traffic to only what is necessary reduces the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security Groups' column to ensure no instance
      is associated with a security group named 'default'.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group if not specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with appropriate rules that restrict inbound and
      outbound traffic.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances currently using the default
      security group.
    - Remove the instances from the default security group.
