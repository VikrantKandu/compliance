    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs that have been
      approved by the organization. This helps in maintaining consistency, security,
      and compliance across the infrastructure.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are configured according
      to organizational standards and security policies. It reduces the risk of deploying
      instances with vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, which can lead to security
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID of each instance against the list of approved AMIs.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDKs to programmatically retrieve and verify the
      AMI IDs of running instances.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Stop the non-compliant instances.
    - Launch new instances using approved AMIs.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instances after ensuring data and configuration
      are preserved.
