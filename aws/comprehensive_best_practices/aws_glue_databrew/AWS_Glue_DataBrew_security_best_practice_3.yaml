    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps safeguard
      against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA is crucial as it significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's credentials
      can easily access AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" to view the list of IAM users.
    - Check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and choose a user to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", click "Manage" and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
