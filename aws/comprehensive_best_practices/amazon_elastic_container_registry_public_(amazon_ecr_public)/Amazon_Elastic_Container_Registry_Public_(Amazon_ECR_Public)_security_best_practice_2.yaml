    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance with organizational
      policies.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities and compliance
      risks, as they may not have the necessary security patches or configurations.
      Approved AMIs are vetted to ensure they meet security and operational standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID and verify it against the list of approved
      AMIs maintained by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Stop the instance and create an AMI from it if necessary.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate data and applications to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance using the unapproved AMI.
