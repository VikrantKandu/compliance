  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information stored in S3 buckets.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Under 'Block public access', ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
