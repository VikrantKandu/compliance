    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private by default protects sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible S3
      buckets can expose confidential information, leading to security and compliance
      issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the permissions settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings programmatically.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not grant public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
