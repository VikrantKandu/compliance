    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance types
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are running on the latest
      generation instance types to take advantage of improved performance, security
      features, and cost efficiencies.
    Rationale: Using the latest generation instance types provides better performance,
      enhanced security features, and often improved cost efficiency. Older instance
      types may lack support for newer features and optimizations, potentially leading
      to increased costs and security vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Review the list of running instances and their instance types.
    - Verify that each instance type belongs to the latest generation of instances.
    Default Value: Many EC2 instances may still be running on older generation instance
      types.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running on older generation instance types.
    - Plan and execute a migration strategy to move these instances to the latest
      generation instance types.
    - Ensure that the new instance types meet the performance and cost requirements
      for your workloads.
