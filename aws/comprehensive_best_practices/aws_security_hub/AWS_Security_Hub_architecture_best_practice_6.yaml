    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enforced in AWS
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enhance security by requiring users
      to create complex passwords.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by ensuring that user passwords are difficult to guess or crack. Without
      a strong password policy, accounts may be vulnerable to brute force attacks
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Account settings."
    - Ensure that the password policy is set with the following requirements:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Requires at least one uppercase letter.
      - Requires at least one lowercase letter.
      - Requires at least one number.
      - Requires at least one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Prevents password reuse.
    Default Value: By default, no password policy is enforced in IAM.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Account settings."
    - Click "Manage password policy."
    - Configure the password policy with the recommended requirements.
    - Save changes to enforce the new password policy.
