  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can
      lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you reduce the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to the internet. Unauthorized users could potentially view, modify,
      or delete the data if the buckets are publicly accessible.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each S3 bucket. 4.
      Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled for each bucket unless there
      is a documented business need for public access.
  - Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 4. Under "Block public access (bucket settings)", click "Edit". 5. Check
      "Block all public access" and save the changes. 6. Review and remove any bucket
      policies or ACLs that grant public access unless necessary.
