  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide not only a password but also a second form of
      verification, such as a code from a mobile device.
  - Rationale: Implementing MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, if a password is compromised, an attacker can gain full access
      to resources, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA' column for each
      user to ensure MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA
      device to the user.
