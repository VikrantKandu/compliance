    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive data is
      exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible protects against unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust the bucket's access control list (ACL) to ensure no public
      access is granted.
