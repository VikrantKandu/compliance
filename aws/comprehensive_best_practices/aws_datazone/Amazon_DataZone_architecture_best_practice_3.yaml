    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to provide an additional
      layer of security beyond just a username and password. MFA requires users to
      present a second form of identification, such as a code from a hardware device
      or an app on a smartphone, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of user accounts by requiring a
      second form of identification. If MFA is not enabled, accounts are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, especially if passwords are compromised. This can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized actions within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage' and follow the instructions to
      assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Ensure each user has an MFA device configured and enforced for login.
