    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private, ensuring
      that no unauthorized access is allowed. This involves verifying that bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) are set to restrict access to only
      authorized users.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and
      exposure of sensitive information, which can have severe legal and financial
      repercussions.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and identify any that are publicly accessible.
      4. Check the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
      5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to
      programmatically check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions. 2. Modify the ACL to ensure that only
      authorized users and roles have access. 3. Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access
      feature to prevent future public access configurations. 4. Regularly review
      and audit bucket policies and ACLs to maintain compliance.
