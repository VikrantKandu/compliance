    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security. Enabling MFA provides an additional layer
      of security by requiring a second form of verification, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to compromise through
      phishing attacks or leaked credentials. Enabling MFA helps protect sensitive
      resources by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
