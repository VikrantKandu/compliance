    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
