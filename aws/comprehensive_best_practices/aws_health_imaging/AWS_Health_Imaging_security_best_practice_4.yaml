    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and not publicly accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leakage. Ensuring that buckets are private helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but configurations can
      be changed to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access.
