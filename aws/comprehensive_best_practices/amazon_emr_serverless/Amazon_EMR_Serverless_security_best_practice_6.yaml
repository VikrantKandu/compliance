    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets private helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access, reducing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - Check the permissions for each bucket to ensure that they are not publicly accessible.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify bucket ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL settings to remove any public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to apply the necessary changes to the bucket policy and ACLs.
