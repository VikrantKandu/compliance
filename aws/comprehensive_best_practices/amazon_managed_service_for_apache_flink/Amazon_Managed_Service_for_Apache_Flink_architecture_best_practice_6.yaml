    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to control access to the bucket.
