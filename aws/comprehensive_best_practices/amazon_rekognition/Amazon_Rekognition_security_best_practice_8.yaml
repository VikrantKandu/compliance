    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or unauthorized data
      access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure, data
      loss, and compliance violations. It is crucial to restrict access to only authorized
      users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
