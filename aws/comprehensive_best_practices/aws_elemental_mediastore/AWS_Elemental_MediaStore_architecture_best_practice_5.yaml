    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps safeguard sensitive
      data against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling encryption ensures
      that data is protected and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties for server-side encryption settings.
    - Ensure that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption method, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
