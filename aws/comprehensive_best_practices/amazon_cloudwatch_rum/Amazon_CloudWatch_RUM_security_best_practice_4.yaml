    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be set to private by default to prevent unauthorized
      public access to sensitive data. This ensures that only authenticated users
      can access the bucket contents unless explicitly made public.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      this risk and aligns with the principle of least privilege.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and review its permissions.
    - Ensure the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy to restrict access.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket ACL.
    - Use the AWS console or CLI to apply the changes and verify the bucket is private.
