    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private protects sensitive information
      from being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions to ensure no public access is
      granted.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any 'Allow' statements
      that grant 'Everyone' or 'Any authenticated AWS user' access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the 'Block Public Access' setting for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
