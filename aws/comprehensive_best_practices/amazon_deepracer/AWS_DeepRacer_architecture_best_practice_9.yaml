    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances do not have a public IP address to prevent
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible instances are more vulnerable to attacks
      and data breaches.
    Rationale: Public IP addresses expose EC2 instances to the internet, increasing
      the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Limiting exposure
      by ensuring instances are private enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Review the list of instances and check the Networking tab for each instance.
    - Verify that no instances have a public IP address assigned.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with a public IP address
      unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - If any instances have a public IP address, modify the instance settings to remove
      the public IP.
    - Alternatively, configure a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure instances are
      launched without a public IP.
    - Use a bastion host or VPN for secure access to instances if needed.
