    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, which poses a significant security risk. Ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for any buckets marked as
      "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open its properties.
    - Check the permissions tab to ensure there are no public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any bucket marked as "Public", click on the bucket name to open its properties.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access permissions.
    - Apply a bucket policy or access control list (ACL) that restricts access to
      authorized users only.
