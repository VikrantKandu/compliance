    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a security risk as they can allow
      unauthorized users to view or modify data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket permissions do not allow public access by checking that
      'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are set to block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
