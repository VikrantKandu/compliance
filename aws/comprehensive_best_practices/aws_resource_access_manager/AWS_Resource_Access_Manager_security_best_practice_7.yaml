    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or unintended
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information
      and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List (ACL)" settings
      to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that the policy status is not public.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and do not allow
      public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to configure the bucket settings to
      block all public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
