  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab to ensure that no public
      access is granted. 4. Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs)
      do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check the policy status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have public access unless explicitly
      configured.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access. 2.
      Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings for
      the bucket. 3. Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
