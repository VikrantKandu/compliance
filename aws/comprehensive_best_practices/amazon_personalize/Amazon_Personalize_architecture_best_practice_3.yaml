    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      when logging into the AWS Management Console or making programmatic requests.
      This best practice ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to protect against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's
      credentials are compromised, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to AWS
      services and data.
    Audit: To verify compliance, log into the AWS Management Console and navigate
      to the IAM dashboard. Check each IAM user to ensure that MFA is enabled. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list all users and aws iam get-user
      for each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: To remediate, log into the AWS Management Console, navigate to the
      IAM dashboard, and select the user. Under the Security credentials tab, choose
      to Manage MFA device and follow the instructions to enable MFA. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI to associate an MFA device with the user.
