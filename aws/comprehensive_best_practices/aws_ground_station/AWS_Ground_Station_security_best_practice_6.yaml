    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps safeguard
      against unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      can gain complete access to the user's permissions. MFA significantly reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to see if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
