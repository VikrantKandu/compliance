    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      root account in AWS to provide an additional layer of security. This helps protect
      the account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is crucial because the root account
      has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. Without MFA, the
      account is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches,
      resource manipulation, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user with administrative privileges.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the "Security Status" section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and verify
      that the AccountMFAEnabled field is set to true.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the "Security Status" section, click "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to configure a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA setup by entering the generated codes.
