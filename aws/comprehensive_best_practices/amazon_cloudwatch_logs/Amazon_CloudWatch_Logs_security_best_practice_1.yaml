    Title: Ensure EC2 EBS volumes are encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes attached
      to EC2 instances are encrypted to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard
      sensitive information and meets compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Encrypting EBS volumes protects sensitive data from unauthorized access,
      especially in the event of a security breach. Unencrypted data can be vulnerable
      to data theft and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select "Volumes" from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - Review the list of volumes and ensure the "Encryption" column indicates "Encrypted"
      for each volume.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-volumes and verify that
      the "Encrypted" field is set to true for all volumes.
    Default Value: By default, EBS volumes are not encrypted, and encryption must
      be explicitly enabled at the time of volume creation.
    Remediation:
    - Identify unencrypted EBS volumes.
    - Create a snapshot of each unencrypted volume.
    - Create a new encrypted volume from the snapshot.
    - Detach the unencrypted volume and attach the new encrypted volume to the instance.
    - Ensure that the application using the volume is properly configured to use the
      new encrypted volume.
