    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access
      Management (IAM) users to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of
      protection by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a physical token or a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
      If MFA is not enabled, unauthorized users could gain access to AWS resources
      by stealing passwords, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
