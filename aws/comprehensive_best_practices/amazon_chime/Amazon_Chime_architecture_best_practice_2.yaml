  - ID: AWS-S3-01
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which could lead
      to data exposure. This involves checking bucket policies and access control
      lists (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, resulting in potential data breaches and compliance violations.
      Restricting access to only those who need it mitigates this risk.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review each bucket's permissions by checking the bucket policy and ACL settings.
      4. Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy to remove public access permissions. 2. Enable 'Block all public access'
      settings for the bucket. 3. Review and adjust the ACLs to ensure only authorized
      users have access.
