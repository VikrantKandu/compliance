    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the ACL to remove any public permissions.
    - Utilize the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
