    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an additional
      layer of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access to a user's password
      can access AWS resources. With MFA, even if the password is compromised, the
      attacker would still need the second factor to gain access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
