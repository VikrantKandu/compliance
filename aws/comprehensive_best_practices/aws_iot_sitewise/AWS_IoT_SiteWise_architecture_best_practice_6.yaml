    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access. This best practice is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as anyone
      on the internet can access the data. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions to ensure that 'Block all public access' is
      enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACL settings and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket ACLs to remove public permissions, if necessary.
