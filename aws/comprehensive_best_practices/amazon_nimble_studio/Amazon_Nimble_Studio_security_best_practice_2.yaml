    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by attackers to access
      or exfiltrate sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk
      of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Utilize AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
