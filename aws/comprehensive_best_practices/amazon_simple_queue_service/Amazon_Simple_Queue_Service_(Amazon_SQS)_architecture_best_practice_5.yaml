    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protect sensitive information
      from unauthorized access. Public buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' to verify the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy' to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to update the bucket policy and ACLs programmatically.
    - Re-evaluate the bucket settings to ensure compliance.
