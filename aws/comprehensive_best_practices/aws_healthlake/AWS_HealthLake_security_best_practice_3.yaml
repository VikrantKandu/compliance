    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets
      should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required for a specific
      use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of accidental
      data leaks and enhances overall data security.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list all S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify
      that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Confirm that the bucket's Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not private by default unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL for each S3 bucket and remove any public access
      permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for all S3 buckets to prevent public access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict
      access to the buckets.
