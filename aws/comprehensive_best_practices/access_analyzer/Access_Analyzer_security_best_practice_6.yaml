    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can expose instances to unnecessary risks.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to potential security vulnerabilities
      as they allow unrestricted access. It is a best practice to create custom security
      groups with specific rules to control traffic to and from your instances.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Open the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Step 5: Ensure that none of the instances are associated with the default security
        group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify the instances using the default security group.
    - Step 2: Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Step 3: Associate the new security group with the identified instances.
    - Step 4: Remove the instances from the default security group.
