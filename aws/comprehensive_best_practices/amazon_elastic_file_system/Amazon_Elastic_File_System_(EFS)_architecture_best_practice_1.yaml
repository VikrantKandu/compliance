    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps to protect
      sensitive data by encrypting it before storing it in the cloud.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and data breaches. Encrypting data at rest ensures that
      even if the data is accessed without authorization, it cannot be read without
      the encryption key.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the default encryption settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket has server-side encryption enabled with either AWS-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab.
    - Under the Default Encryption section, select "Enable" for server-side encryption.
    - Choose either AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) and
      save the settings.
