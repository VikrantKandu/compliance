    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict access to only authorized users and roles.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the risk of data being
      accessed by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure 'Block all public access' settings are
      enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
