    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access, as it requires not only a password but also a second factor that an
      attacker is unlikely to possess. Without MFA, an attacker could potentially
      gain access if they obtain a user's credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', select 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
