    Title: Ensure CloudFront distributions have logging enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFront distributions have logging
      enabled to capture detailed information about viewer requests for your content.
      Logging helps in monitoring, troubleshooting, and analyzing the performance
      of the distribution.
    Rationale: Enabling logging for CloudFront distributions is crucial for maintaining
      visibility into access patterns, identifying potential security threats, and
      ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Without logging, it becomes
      challenging to investigate incidents or optimize distribution performance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select a distribution and check the 'Logging' section under the 'General' tab.
    - Verify that logging is enabled and a valid S3 bucket is specified for storing
      logs.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFront distributions do not have logging enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select the distribution for which you want to enable logging.
    - In the 'General' tab, enable the 'Logging' option.
    - Specify an existing S3 bucket or create a new one to store the logs.
    - Save the changes to enable logging for the distribution.
