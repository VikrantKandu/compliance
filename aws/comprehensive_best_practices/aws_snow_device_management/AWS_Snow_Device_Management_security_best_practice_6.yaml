    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is essential to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches, compliance
      violations, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public" access status.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to restrict public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access.
