    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by attackers, leading to data exposure and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public
      access settings enabled.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to verify that public access is blocked
      for the account and specific buckets.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Public access settings.
    - Enable the Block all public access setting.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
