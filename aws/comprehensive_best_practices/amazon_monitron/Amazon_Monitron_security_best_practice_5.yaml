  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in these buckets.
      Public access can be restricted by configuring bucket policies and access control
      lists appropriately.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as unauthorized
      users may be able to access sensitive or confidential information. Ensuring
      that buckets are not publicly accessible helps to protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list to ensure that
      public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to review the bucket's ACL and policy configurations.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have any public access settings enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Modify the access control list to restrict access to specific AWS accounts or
      IAM users.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to block public access to all buckets
      in the account.
