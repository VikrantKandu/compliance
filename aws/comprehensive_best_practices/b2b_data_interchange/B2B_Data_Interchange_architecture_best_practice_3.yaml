    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enforced for
      AWS IAM users to enhance account security. A password policy defines the complexity,
      length, and rotation requirements of passwords.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by ensuring that users create complex and difficult-to-guess passwords.
      Without a password policy, accounts are vulnerable to brute force attacks and
      other unauthorized access attempts.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that a password policy is enabled and configured with at least the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of 8 characters.
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Password expiration period is set.
    Default Value: AWS accounts do not have a password policy enabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Click 'Set password policy'.
    - Configure the password policy with the recommended settings.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
