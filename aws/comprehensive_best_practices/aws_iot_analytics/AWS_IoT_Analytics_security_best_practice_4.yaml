    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to stolen credentials. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access
      to a user's password can log in and perform any actions the user is authorized
      to do, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user listed.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user you want to enable MFA for.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Manage.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
