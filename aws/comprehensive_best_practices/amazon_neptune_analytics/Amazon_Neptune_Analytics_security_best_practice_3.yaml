    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: By restricting public access to S3 buckets, organizations can protect
      their data from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to access, modify, or delete data, leading to potential data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the 'Block public
      access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked. 5. Verify that bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Enable 'Block all public access' on the S3 bucket. 2. Review and
      modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access. 3.
      Regularly audit S3 buckets to ensure compliance with this best practice.
