    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      information to the internet, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Step 4: Ensure that each bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify bucket ACLs are not set to public.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Step 4: Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Step 5: Disable any public access settings and remove public access policies.
    - Step 6: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        --acl private to set the bucket ACL to private.
