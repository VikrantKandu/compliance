    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enabled
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      by adding an additional layer of security. Without MFA, if a user's credentials
      are compromised, an attacker could gain access to AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select each user to verify if
      MFA is enabled under the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Ensure that all users
      have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. In the "Security credentials" tab, choose "Manage
      MFA". 6. Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
