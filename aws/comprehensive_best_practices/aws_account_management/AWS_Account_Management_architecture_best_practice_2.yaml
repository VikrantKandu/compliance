    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are not publicly accessible.
      Instances should not have a public IP address unless necessary, and security
      groups should restrict access to trusted IPs.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible EC2 instances can be vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and potential attacks. Limiting access reduces the risk of exposure to
      threats.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Step 3: Check each EC2 instance for public IP addresses.
    - Step 4: Review the security group settings to ensure only trusted IPs are allowed.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may have public IP addresses and open security group
      settings by default.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Remove public IP addresses from EC2 instances that do not require
        them.
    - Action 2: Update security group rules to restrict access to known and trusted
        IP addresses only.
