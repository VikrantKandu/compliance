    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to the
      AWS account by requiring not only a password but also a second factor, such
      as a smartphone app, to authenticate users.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect the AWS account from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain
      full access to the account. MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled under the "Security credentials" tab.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the IAM user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Under the "Security credentials" tab, choose
      "Manage MFA". 6. Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to
      the user.
