    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can be granted
      through bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs), which should be reviewed
      and restricted.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not public helps
      protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket policies and ACLs and verify
      their configurations.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings in the S3 console to block all public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
