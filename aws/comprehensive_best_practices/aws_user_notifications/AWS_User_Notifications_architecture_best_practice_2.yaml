    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched with the
      latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure they include the latest security
      patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer releases. Ensuring instances use the latest AMIs minimizes
      security risks and improves system stability.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID of each instance.
    - Compare the AMI IDs with the latest available AMIs in the AWS Marketplace or
      your custom AMI catalog.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMIs unless
      specified during instance launch or update.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new AMI from the latest version available.
    - Plan for and execute an update or replacement of instances with the latest AMI.
    - Test the new instances thoroughly to ensure functionality and security.
