    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. Ensuring that buckets are private
      helps protect against unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify that the bucket ACL does
      not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to ensure the bucket policy
      does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to update the bucket settings to restrict
      access.
