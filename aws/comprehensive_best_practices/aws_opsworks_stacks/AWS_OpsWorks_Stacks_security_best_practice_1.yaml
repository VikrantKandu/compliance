    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to authorized
      users only is crucial for maintaining data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, ensure 'Block Public Access' settings are turned on.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
