    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not using default security
      groups, which typically allow unrestricted inbound access. Using custom security
      groups with specific rules helps to minimize exposure to potential threats.
    Rationale: Default security groups often allow broad access, which can pose security
      risks by exposing instances to unauthorized access. Defining restrictive security
      groups helps protect instances from potential attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security Groups' column to ensure it does not
      list the default security group.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the security groups associated with each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound access.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the application's needs.
    - Detach the default security group from the instance and attach the custom security
      group.
