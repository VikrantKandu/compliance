    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS accounts to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification to access an account,
      significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances account security by requiring an additional verification
      method beyond just a password. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible to
      compromise through phishing attacks, credential theft, or brute force attacks,
      potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Ensure that MFA is also enabled for the root account by navigating to 'My Security
      Credentials' under the account dropdown menu.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for AWS accounts.
    Remediation:
    - For each IAM user, navigate to the user's security credentials in the AWS Management
      Console and enable MFA.
    - For the root account, go to 'My Security Credentials' and enable MFA by following
      the on-screen instructions.
    - Use a virtual MFA application, a hardware MFA device, or a U2F security key
      to complete the setup process.
