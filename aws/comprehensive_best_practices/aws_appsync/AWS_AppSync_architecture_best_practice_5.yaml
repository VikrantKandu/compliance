  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Verify that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      ensure data protection and privacy.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow
        public access.
    - Step 5: Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to run 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api
        get-bucket-policy' to programmatically check for public access configurations.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured to be public.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Step 2: Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Step 3: Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance
        with the organization's security policies.
