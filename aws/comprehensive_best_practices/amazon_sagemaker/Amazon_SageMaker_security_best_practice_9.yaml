    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to anyone on the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data
      exposure and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks, compliance violations, and financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check the ACLs and bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account
      level.
    - Re-evaluate the need for public access and apply the principle of least privilege.
