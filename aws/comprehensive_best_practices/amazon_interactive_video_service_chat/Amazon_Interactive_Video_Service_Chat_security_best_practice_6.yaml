    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, which may result in
      data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access. Public access can lead to accidental data leaks, compliance
      violations, and financial loss due to data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL for public permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no unintended public access
      is granted.
