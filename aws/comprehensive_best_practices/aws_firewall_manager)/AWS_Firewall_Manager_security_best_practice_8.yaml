    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security
      to user logins by requiring a second form of verification. This helps protect
      user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to password theft or guessing
      attacks, which could lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify MFA devices are associated with each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose a user and click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users.
