    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are not public protects sensitive information and complies
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions and settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Remove any public access granted via the bucket ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
