    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to data stored in the cloud. Public access should
      be restricted to ensure data privacy and security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the
      risk of data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Check the 'Block Public
      Access' settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Verify that bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable 'Block all
      public access' settings. 5. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove
      any public access permissions.
