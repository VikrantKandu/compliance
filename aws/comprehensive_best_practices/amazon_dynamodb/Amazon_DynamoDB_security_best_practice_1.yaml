    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to authorized users only helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
      4. Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with no public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Adjust the bucket policy
      and ACL to remove public access. 5. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to
      restrict public access at the account level.
