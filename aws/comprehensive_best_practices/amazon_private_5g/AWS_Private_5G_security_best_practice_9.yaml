  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure, as sensitive information can be accessed by anyone on the internet.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check bucket policies for any public access permissions using aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket permissions to remove public access.
    - Modify or remove any bucket policies that grant public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
