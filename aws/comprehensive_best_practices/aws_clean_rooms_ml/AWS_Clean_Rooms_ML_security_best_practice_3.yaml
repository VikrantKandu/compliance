    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in the AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the
      user has on them, i.e., a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, compromised credentials could lead
      to unauthorized access and potential misuse of AWS resources.
    Audit: Log in to the AWS Management Console. Navigate to the IAM dashboard. Check
      each IAM user to ensure MFA is enabled. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and verify that each user has an associated
      MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: To enable MFA, go to the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
      Select the user you want to enable MFA for, click on the 'Security credentials'
      tab, and follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
