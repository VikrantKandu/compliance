    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and performance updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose your infrastructure to unpatched vulnerabilities
      and performance issues. Regularly updating to the latest AMIs ensures that instances
      benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the AMI ID used to launch it.
    - Step 5: Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI IDs for your region.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with older AMIs if not regularly updated.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Step 2: Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Step 3: Migrate necessary data and configurations to the new instance.
    - Step 4: Terminate the old instance once the new instance is verified to be running
        correctly.
