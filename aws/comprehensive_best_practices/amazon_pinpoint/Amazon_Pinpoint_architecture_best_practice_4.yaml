    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure.
      By restricting public access, organizations can protect sensitive data from
      being accessed or modified by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all
      public access' setting is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify that they do
      not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
