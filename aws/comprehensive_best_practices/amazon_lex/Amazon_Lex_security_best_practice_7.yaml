    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is important to regularly
      review and manage bucket permissions to protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. By restricting public access, you can
      prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
