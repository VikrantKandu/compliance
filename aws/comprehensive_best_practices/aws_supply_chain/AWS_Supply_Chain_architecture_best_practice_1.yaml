    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions that could expose sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that public access is disabled.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm that public access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
