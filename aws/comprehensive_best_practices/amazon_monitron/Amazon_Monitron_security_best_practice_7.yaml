    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles instead of individual
      users to simplify policy management and reduce the risk of excessive permissions.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      management and increase the risk of granting excessive permissions. By attaching
      policies to groups or roles, it is easier to manage permissions consistently
      and securely.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: Check the list of IAM users and verify that no policies are directly
        attached to users.
    - Step 4: Review IAM policies and ensure they are attached to groups or roles.
    Default Value: IAM policies are not attached directly to users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify any IAM policies directly attached to users.
    - Step 2: Detach the policies from users and attach them to appropriate groups
        or roles.
    - Step 3: Ensure users are added to groups or roles with the necessary permissions.
