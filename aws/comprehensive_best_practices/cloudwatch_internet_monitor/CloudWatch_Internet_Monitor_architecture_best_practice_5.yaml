    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions
      enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects against data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone, leading
      to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for public access indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the Permissions tab, and check
      the Block public access settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not have public access enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove
      any public permissions.
