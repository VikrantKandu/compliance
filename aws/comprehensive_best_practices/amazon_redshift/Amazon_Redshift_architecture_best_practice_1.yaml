    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Not Using Default Security Groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. This can expose the instance
      to unnecessary risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      your instances to the internet or other instances. This increases the risk of
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create custom security groups with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your application needs.
    - Associate the custom security group with your EC2 instances.
    - Remove the association of the default security group from all EC2 instances.
