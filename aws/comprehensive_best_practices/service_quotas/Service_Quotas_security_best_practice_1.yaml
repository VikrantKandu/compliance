    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by attackers to access, modify, or delete data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL for public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      programmatically check the bucket policy for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and edit the bucket policy to remove any public
      access statements.
    - Remove any public ACL settings.
    - Consider enabling 'Block all public access' settings for the bucket.
