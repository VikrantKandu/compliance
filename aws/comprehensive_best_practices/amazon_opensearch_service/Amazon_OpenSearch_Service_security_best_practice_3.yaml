    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured with
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption automatically
      encrypts data before it is stored in S3 and decrypts it when accessed, providing
      an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
      access and data breaches. Without server-side encryption, stored data may be
      vulnerable to exposure if accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the properties.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption option (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to ensure encryption is applied to the bucket.
