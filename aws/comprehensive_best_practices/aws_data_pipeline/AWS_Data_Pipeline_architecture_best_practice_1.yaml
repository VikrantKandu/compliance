    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Verify that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled. 5. Ensure no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab and click 'Edit' under 'Block public access'. 5. Enable 'Block all public
      access' and save changes. 6. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove
      public access permissions.
