    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access unless explicitly needed.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify its permissions to restrict
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to edit bucket permissions and disable public
      access.
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure only authorized users have access.
