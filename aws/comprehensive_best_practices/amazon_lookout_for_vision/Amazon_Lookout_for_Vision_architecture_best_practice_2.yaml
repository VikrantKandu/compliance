    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      such as a code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access, even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks such as phishing and brute force attempts.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Users' section.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      that all users have MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, choose 'Security credentials' and select 'Manage
      MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device for the user.
