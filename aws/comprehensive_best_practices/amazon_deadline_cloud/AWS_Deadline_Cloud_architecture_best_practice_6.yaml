    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk, as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      data access, data leaks, and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to
      ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
