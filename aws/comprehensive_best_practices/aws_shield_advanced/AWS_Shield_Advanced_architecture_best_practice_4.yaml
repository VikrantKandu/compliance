    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, posing
      a security risk.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive information
      is exposed. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data
      from unauthorized access and potential exploitation.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and not publicly
      accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to ensure they do not grant public access.
