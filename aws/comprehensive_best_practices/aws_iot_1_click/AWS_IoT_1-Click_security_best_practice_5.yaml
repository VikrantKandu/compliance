    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are private by default to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be explicitly
      granted only when necessary.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default minimizes the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and potential legal and financial repercussions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private and block all public access by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is non-compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
