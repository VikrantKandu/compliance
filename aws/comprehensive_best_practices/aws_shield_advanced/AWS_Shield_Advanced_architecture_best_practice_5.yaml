    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to potential data loss and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the permissions and bucket policy. 4. Ensure that
      'Block all public access' settings are enabled. 5. Verify that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Click on 'Permissions'. 4. Enable 'Block all public access'. 5. Review and
      modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
