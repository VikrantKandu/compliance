    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible. Making S3 buckets private helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintentional data exposure,
      making sensitive information accessible to anyone on the internet. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be changed
      to make them public.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL and bucket policy to remove any public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
