  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to password theft or phishing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised
      password could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users." 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users to list users and aws iam get-user to check MFA status for
      each user.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users." 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. Under "Assigned
      MFA device," choose "Manage MFA device." 7. Follow the prompts to enable and
      configure a virtual or hardware MFA device for the user.
