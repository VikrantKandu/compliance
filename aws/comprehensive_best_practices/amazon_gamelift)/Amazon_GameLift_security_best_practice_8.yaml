    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, security, and compliance
      across the environment.
    Rationale: Using unapproved or outdated AMIs can lead to security vulnerabilities,
      lack of compliance with organizational policies, and operational inconsistencies.
      Approved AMIs are vetted and maintained to ensure they meet security and operational
      standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Review the 'AMI ID' for each instance and verify it against the list of approved
      AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data from the non-compliant instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance once migration is complete.
