    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to anyone on the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. If a bucket is publicly accessible, it can lead
      to data leakage, compliance violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the Access Control List (ACL) and bucket policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy or ACL that grants public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and do not allow
      public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to modify the ACL settings to remove public
      access.
    - Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
