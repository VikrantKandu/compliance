    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict access to only trusted
      users and applications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings in the S3 console to prevent public access
      at the account level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
