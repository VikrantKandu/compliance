    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication factor
      beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to
      compromise through phishing attacks or password theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
