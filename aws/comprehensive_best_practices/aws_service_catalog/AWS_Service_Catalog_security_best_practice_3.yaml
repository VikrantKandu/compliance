    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
    - Use the AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL
        settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to set the bucket policy to private.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
