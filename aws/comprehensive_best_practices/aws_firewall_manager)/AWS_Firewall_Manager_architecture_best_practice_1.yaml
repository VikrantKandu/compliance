    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances do not have public IP addresses,
      which could expose them to the internet and increase security risks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible EC2 instances can be targeted by attackers, leading
      to potential data breaches or unauthorized access. Limiting access to private
      IP addresses reduces the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the Public IP column.
    - Verify that no instances have a public IP address unless absolutely necessary.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with public IP addresses.
    Remediation:
    - Reconfigure instances to use private IP addresses.
    - If public access is required, ensure security groups and network ACLs are configured
      to restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.
