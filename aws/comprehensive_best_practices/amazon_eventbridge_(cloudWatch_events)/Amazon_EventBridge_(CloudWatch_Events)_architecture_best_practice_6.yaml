    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data leaks and
      potential security incidents. By restricting public access, you minimize the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure and ensure that only authenticated users
      can access the data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Regularly monitor buckets for any changes to public access settings.
    - Use AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail to continuously monitor and alert on changes
      to bucket permissions.
