    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication, enhancing the security of user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, a compromised password could allow an attacker to gain access to
      sensitive resources and data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), click on Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
