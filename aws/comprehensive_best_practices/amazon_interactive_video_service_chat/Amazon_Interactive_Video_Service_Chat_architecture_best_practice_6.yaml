    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by attackers to access and manipulate sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have "Public Access" enabled or any bucket policy
      granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any bucket with public access, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy or access control list (ACL) to remove public access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
