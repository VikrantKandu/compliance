    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled through bucket policies or access
      control lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to all buckets
      in the account.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
