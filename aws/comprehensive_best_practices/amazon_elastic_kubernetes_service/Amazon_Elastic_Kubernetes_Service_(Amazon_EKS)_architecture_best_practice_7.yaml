    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security
      to the authentication process.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access by requiring a second form of authentication. Without MFA, accounts are
      more vulnerable to attacks, such as password guessing or phishing.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA
        devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure MFA for the user.
