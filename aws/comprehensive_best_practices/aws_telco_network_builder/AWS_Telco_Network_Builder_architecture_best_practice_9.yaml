    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can pose a significant security risk if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches, as it is open to all traffic by default. Ensuring EC2
      instances are associated with custom security groups with specific rules enhances
      security by restricting access to only necessary ports and IPs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - Check the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, an EC2 instance is associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your application's needs.
    - Detach the default security group and attach the custom security group to the
      instances.
