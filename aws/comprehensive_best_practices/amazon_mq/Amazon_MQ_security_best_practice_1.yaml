    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data leaks,
      intellectual property loss, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List (ACL)" settings.
    - Ensure that there are no policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature to verify it is enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
