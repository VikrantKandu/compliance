    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an extra
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could allow attackers to access
      and manipulate AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches or service
      disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
