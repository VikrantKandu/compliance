    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to the
      internet, making it vulnerable to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private helps maintain data confidentiality and
      integrity, reducing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Check the bucket settings for any public access configurations and ensure they
      are disabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Ensure the bucket's public access settings are configured to block all public
      access.
    - Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
