    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound traffic from other instances
      within the same security group and unrestricted outbound traffic, which could
      pose security risks.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it generally allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic. This
      can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, check the associated
      security groups. 5. Verify that none of the instances are using the default
      security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may use the default security group
      unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules. 3. Associate
      the new security group with the affected EC2 instances. 4. Remove the default
      security group association from these instances.
