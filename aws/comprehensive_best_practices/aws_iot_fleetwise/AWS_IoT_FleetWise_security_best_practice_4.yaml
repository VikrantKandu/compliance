    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to exposure in the event of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Default encryption" setting under the "Properties"
      tab.
    - Verify that the encryption is enabled with either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and click on "Default encryption."
    - Enable server-side encryption with either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
