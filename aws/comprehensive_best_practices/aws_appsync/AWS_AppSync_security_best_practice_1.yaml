    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before they can access an account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If the root account credentials are compromised, MFA will
      provide an additional barrier that an attacker must bypass. Without MFA, the
      root account is vulnerable to attacks that could lead to severe consequences,
      including loss of data and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the 'Users' section and check the root account settings.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the 'Security Status' section, choose 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA by selecting a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
    - Complete the setup by entering the authentication codes provided by the MFA
      device.
