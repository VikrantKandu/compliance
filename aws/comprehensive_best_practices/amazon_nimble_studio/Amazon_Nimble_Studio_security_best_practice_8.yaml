    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. It is crucial to restrict access to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to specific users or roles.
