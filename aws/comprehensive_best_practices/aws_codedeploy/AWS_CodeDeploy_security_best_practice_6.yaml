    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides an additional
      layer of data protection by encrypting data stored in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties for server-side encryption settings.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, server-side encryption is not enabled on S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the properties section of the bucket.
    - Enable server-side encryption by selecting an encryption method, such as AES-256
      or AWS-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption to the bucket.
