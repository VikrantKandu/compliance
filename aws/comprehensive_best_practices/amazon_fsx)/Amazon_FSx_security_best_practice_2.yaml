  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS IAM users to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access, as it requires a second form of authentication beyond just a password.
      Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA devices.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
