    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that your Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the bucket's policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access settings for the
      bucket.
    - Regularly monitor and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
