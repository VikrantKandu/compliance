  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain compliance with data protection standards.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings. 4. Verify that
      "Block all public access" is enabled or that specific permissions are reviewed
      and justified.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access unless configured
      otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on "Edit" under the "Block
      public access" settings. 4. Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
      5. Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted unintentionally.
