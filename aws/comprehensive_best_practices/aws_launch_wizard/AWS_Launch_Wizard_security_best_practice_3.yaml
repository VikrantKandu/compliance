    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are not launched in the default
      VPC. Using a custom VPC allows for better control over network configurations
      and security settings.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in the default VPC may lead to less control
      over network configurations, potentially exposing the instances to security
      risks. Custom VPCs provide more granular control over networking and security,
      such as custom subnet configurations and security groups.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the VPC ID under the 'Description' tab.
    - Step 5: Verify that the VPC ID is not the default VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched in the default VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify EC2 instances running in the default VPC.
    - Step 2: Plan and create a custom VPC with appropriate subnets and security groups.
    - Step 3: Migrate the EC2 instances to the custom VPC.
    - Step 4: Update any dependencies or configurations to reflect the new VPC settings.
