  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in accidental data leaks, unauthorized
      data modification, and compliance violations. Restricting public access helps
      protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with security standards.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings and ensure they are enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public
      access.
    - Enable the 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
