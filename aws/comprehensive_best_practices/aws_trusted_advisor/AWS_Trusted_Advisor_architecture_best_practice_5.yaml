    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading to data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring that buckets
      are not public by default helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to verify that it is enabled for all
      buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access for all buckets.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket configurations to ensure compliance with best practices.
