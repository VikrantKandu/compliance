  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      more than one form of verification to access AWS resources, significantly reducing
      the risk of compromised credentials.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial for protecting AWS accounts from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, a compromised user password could lead to
      unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources and data.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled and
      verify compliance.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6.
      In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the
      prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
