    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      public access unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check for any buckets with public access settings enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Disable any public access settings by modifying the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
