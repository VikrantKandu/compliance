    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private reduces this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the Permissions tab to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) are set to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging to track access requests.
    - Implement IAM policies to ensure only authorized users have access.
