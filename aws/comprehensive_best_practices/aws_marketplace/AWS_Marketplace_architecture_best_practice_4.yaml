    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to exposure if accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the properties to confirm that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not encrypted by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method, such as AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS-managed
      keys (SSE-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
