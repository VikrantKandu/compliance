    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic. This ensures
      that security group rules are explicitly defined for each instance, enhancing
      security.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      all inbound and outbound traffic by default. This can lead to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches. Assigning custom security groups with specific
      rules minimizes exposure and enhances security.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane. 4. For each instance, check
      the 'Security groups' column. 5. Ensure no instance is associated with the 'default'
      security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per your security
      requirements. 3. Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances. 4.
      Remove the default security group association from the instances.
