    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      this risk.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets for any with public access enabled. 4. Use the
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the
      ACL settings. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check for any public policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Review and update the bucket policy
      to remove public access permissions. 5. Update the bucket ACL to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
