    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, potentially leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and public access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public read or write permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the bucket's ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket's policy for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to configure the bucket's public access settings
      to block public access.
    - Consider implementing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control
      access to the bucket.
