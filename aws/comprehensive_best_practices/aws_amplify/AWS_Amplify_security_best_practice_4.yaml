    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings to restrict public access to the bucket.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
