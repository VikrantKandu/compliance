    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile app.
      This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, an
      attacker could gain access to your AWS account with just a password, leading
      to potential data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA enabled' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' and 'aws iam get-login-profile'
      to programmatically verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the username for which you want to enable MFA.
    - In the Security credentials tab, click on 'Manage' next to Assigned MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled.
