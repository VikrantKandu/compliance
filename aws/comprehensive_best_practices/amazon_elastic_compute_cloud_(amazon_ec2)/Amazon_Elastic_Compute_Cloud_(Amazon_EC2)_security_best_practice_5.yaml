    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of security to user accounts. MFA
      requires users to provide a second form of identification, which helps prevent
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on IAM user accounts is a crucial security measure that
      helps protect against unauthorized access by requiring additional verification
      beyond just a password. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to compromise
      through password theft or brute force attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure it shows 'Enabled'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
      to programmatically verify the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Click on a user to view details and select 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      and enable an MFA device for the user.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
