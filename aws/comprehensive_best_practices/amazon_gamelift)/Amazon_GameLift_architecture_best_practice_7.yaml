    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets do not allow public access by default
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public by default
      reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting to prevent public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
