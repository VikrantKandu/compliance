    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should have policies that
      restrict public access unless explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are private by default,
      organizations can better protect their data and comply with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      that they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME' to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME' to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets do not allow public access by default unless configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Utilize the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings
      from being applied to your buckets.
    - Regularly audit and monitor bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with
      security best practices.
