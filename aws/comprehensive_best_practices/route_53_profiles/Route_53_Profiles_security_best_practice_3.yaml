    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps protect
      sensitive information and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the permissions tab to review the bucket policy
        and access control list (ACL).
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access and that
        the ACL is not granting public permissions.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
        access.
    - Step 5: Adjust the ACL to ensure it does not grant public permissions.
    - Step 6: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent new public access
        configurations.
