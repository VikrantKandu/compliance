    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS CloudFormation stacks are configured to use encryption
      for sensitive data. This involves using encryption features provided by AWS
      services used within the stack, such as S3 bucket encryption, RDS encryption,
      etc.
    Rationale: Encryption protects sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensures
      data integrity. Without encryption, data could be intercepted or accessed by
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Review each stack's resources for encryption settings. 4. Check
      S3 buckets for default encryption settings. 5. Verify RDS instances have encryption
      enabled. 6. Ensure any other AWS services used in the stack that support encryption
      have it enabled.
    Default Value: CloudFormation stacks do not enforce encryption by default and
      require explicit configuration.
    Remediation: 1. Identify resources within CloudFormation stacks that support encryption.
      2. Modify the CloudFormation template to include encryption settings for these
      resources. 3. Redeploy the stack with the updated template to apply encryption
      settings. 4. Verify that encryption is now enabled for all applicable resources.
