    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of identification, in addition to their password,
      when accessing AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to a breach
      of sensitive data and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
