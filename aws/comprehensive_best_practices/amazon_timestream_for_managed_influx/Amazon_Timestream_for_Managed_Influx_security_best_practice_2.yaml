    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, which
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring
      S3 buckets are private prevents accidental data exposure and enhances data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure no bucket policy grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI to modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
