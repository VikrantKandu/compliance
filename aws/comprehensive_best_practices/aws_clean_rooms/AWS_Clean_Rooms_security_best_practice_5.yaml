  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched using Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) that are approved by the organization. Using approved
      AMIs ensures that instances are configured according to the organization's security
      and compliance standards.
  - Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and non-compliant
      configurations into the environment, potentially leading to security breaches
      and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Approved AMIs are vetted for
      security and compliance, reducing these risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. List all running EC2 instances. 4. Check the AMI ID for each instance. 5.
      Verify that each AMI ID matches an approved list of AMIs maintained by the organization.
  - Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available or custom
      AMI by default.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances not using approved AMIs. 2. For each non-compliant
      instance, create a new instance using an approved AMI. 3. Migrate data and applications
      from the non-compliant instance to the new instance. 4. Terminate the original
      non-compliant instance.
