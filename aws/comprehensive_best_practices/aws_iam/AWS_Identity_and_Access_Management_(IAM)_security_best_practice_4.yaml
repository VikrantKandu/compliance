    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to run the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> and ensure the status is NOT_PUBLIC.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure no public access permissions are
      granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions and adjust as necessary to maintain compliance.
