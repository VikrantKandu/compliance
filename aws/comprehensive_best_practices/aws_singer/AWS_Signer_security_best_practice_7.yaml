    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing
      the protection of AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if user credentials are compromised, attackers
      can gain full access to the account, potentially leading to data breaches and
      unauthorized changes to resources.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - Step 4: Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: Select 'Users' and choose the specific user for whom MFA needs to be
        enabled.
    - Step 4: In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA'.
    - Step 5: Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
