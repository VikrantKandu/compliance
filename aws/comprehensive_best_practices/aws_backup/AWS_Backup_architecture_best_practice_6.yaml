    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Versioning should be enabled on all S3 buckets to protect against
      accidental or malicious data loss. Enabling versioning allows you to preserve,
      retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning provides the ability to recover from both unintended
      user actions and application failures. Without versioning, accidental deletions
      or overwrites can result in data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Versioning" is set to "Enabled".
    Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default on new S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have versioning enabled.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Click on "Versioning" and select "Enable versioning".
    - Save the changes.
