    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. This involves checking bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they do not grant public read or write
      permissions.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or leaks,
      as anyone on the internet can access the data. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and potential
      data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACLs for any entries that allow public access (e.g.,
      Principal set to "*").
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket_name>
      to verify the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, with no public access permissions.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Apply bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
