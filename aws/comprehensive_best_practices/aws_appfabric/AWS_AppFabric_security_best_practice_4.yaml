    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict bucket access to only trusted
      users and applications.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in exposure of confidential
      data, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that buckets do not have 'Public Access' enabled in the permissions tab.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs for public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Disable 'Block all public access' if it is not enabled.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Save changes to apply the updated permissions.
