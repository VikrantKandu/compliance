    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an extra layer
      of security to your AWS accounts. MFA requires users to provide two or more
      verification factors to access resources, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
      Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are stolen, an attacker could gain
      unauthorized access to your AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches
      and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for the MFA device column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage" and follow the steps
      to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
