    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches or data leaks.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors to access, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to compliance
      violations and data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket. 4. Ensure
      that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for all buckets. 5. Verify
      that the bucket policy does not grant public access. 6. Use AWS CLI or SDKs
      to list bucket policies and check for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
      4. Review and update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
      5. Use AWS CLI or SDKs to update bucket policies and ensure public access is
      restricted.
