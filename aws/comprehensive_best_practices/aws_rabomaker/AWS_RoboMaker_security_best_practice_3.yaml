    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public access to buckets can lead to data leaks and potential
      compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to review and modify the bucket permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
