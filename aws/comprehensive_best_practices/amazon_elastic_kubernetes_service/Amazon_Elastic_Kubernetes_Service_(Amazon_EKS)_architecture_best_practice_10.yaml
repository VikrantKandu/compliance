    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      protects data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket has "Public" access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the ACL of each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access using aws s3api get-bucket-policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configuration.
