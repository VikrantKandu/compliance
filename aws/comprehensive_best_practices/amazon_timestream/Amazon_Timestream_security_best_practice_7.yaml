    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to credential
      theft or brute force attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      activity.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select Users.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Choose Manage MFA Device and follow the prompts to enable MFA.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam enable-mfa-device to enable MFA
      for users programmatically.
