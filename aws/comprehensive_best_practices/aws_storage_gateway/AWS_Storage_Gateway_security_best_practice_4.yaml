    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data
      to the internet, leading to potential security incidents and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public read or write access.
    - Verify that the bucket's Public Access Block settings are enabled to block public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not granted
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable Public Access Block settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
