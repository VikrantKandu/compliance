    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS IAM users. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users
      to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check if an MFA device is assigned. This can be verified under
      the "Security credentials" tab for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user to enable MFA for and go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage MFA device" and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device.
    - Ensure all users have an MFA device assigned.
