  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to
      AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, compromised credentials can lead to data
      breaches, unauthorized changes, and other security incidents.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users." 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled by looking for the "MFA enabled" status.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users." 4. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. Under "Assigned
      MFA device," choose "Manage" and follow the steps to assign an MFA device to
      the user.
