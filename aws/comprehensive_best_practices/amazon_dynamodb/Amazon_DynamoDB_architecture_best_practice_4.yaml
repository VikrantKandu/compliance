    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an additional layer of protection on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      accounts, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized changes to resources.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to compromise through password theft
      or brute-force attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
        check the output for devices associated with users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user name to open the user details page.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
