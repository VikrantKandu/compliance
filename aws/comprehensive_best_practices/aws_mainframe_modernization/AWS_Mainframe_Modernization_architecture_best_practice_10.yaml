    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access, which can lead to data exposure. Public access can be granted through
      bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), or both.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches, data leaks, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the settings of each bucket for public access permissions.
    - Check bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check if a bucket is publicly accessible.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, ensure that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements that allow
      public access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict
      access further.
