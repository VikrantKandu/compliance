    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of sensitive
      data exposure and unauthorized data manipulation. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be a target for data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify bucket permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to edit bucket permissions.
    - Implement bucket policies that deny public access or use AWS CLI to update policies
      accordingly.
