    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive information
      is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are private protects
      sensitive data and ensures compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify the settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Adjust the ACL settings to remove any public permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
