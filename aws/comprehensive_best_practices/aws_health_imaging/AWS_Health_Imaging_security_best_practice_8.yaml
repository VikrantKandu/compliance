    Title: Ensure IAM Policies Are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: IAM policies should be attached only to groups or roles to ensure
      centralized management and to avoid excessive permissions being granted to individual
      users.
    Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures and increase the risk of privilege escalation. By attaching policies
      to groups or roles, you can manage permissions more effectively and reduce potential
      security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of users, groups, and roles.
    - Verify that IAM policies are attached only to groups or roles and not directly
      to individual users.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-attached-user-policies to check for policies
      attached directly to users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any IAM policies attached directly to users.
    - Detach these policies from users.
    - Create or use existing groups or roles to attach the necessary policies.
    - Add users to the appropriate groups or assign them the necessary roles.
