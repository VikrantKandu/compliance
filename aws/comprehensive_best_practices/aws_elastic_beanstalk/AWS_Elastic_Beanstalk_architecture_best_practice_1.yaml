    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users and pose significant security risks.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible protects sensitive
      information and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all the S3 buckets in your account.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify that no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access," ensure that all options are checked to block public
      access.
    - Save changes to update the bucket's configuration.
