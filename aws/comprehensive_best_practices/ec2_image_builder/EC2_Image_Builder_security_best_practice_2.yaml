    Title: Ensure CloudWatch Logs are encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudWatch Logs should be encrypted at rest to protect sensitive
      log data. This ensures that log data is not readable by unauthorized parties
      if accessed.
    Rationale: Encrypting CloudWatch Logs protects sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, log data can be exposed
      if accessed by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
    - Step 3: Select Logs from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: Choose a log group and check the Encryption tab to verify if encryption
        is enabled.
    - Step 5: Ensure that a Customer Master Key (CMK) is associated with the log group
        for encryption.
    Default Value: By default, CloudWatch Logs are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
    - Step 3: Select Logs from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: Choose the log group you wish to encrypt.
    - Step 5: Click on the Settings tab and select Encrypt log data.
    - Step 6: Choose a Customer Master Key (CMK) for encryption.
    - Step 7: Save the changes to apply encryption to the log group.
