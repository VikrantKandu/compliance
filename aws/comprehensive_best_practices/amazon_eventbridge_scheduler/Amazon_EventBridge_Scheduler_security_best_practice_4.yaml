    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks as it permits unrestricted access. By ensuring instances are not using
      the default security group, you can enforce stricter access control and reduce
      the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the security groups associated with it.
    - Verify that the security groups do not include the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a custom security group with the necessary rules.
    - Associate the custom security group with the instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
