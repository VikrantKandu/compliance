    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in
      the buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting bucket access
      to authorized users only is crucial for maintaining data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
