  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
      in case of compromised credentials.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
