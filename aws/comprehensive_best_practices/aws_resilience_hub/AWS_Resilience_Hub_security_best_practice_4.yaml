    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches
      and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer versions. This check helps maintain security and stability
      by ensuring instances are up-to-date.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Review the AMI ID of running instances and compare it with the latest available
      AMI for the respective operating system.
    - Verify that the AMI ID matches the latest available version.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may be launched with any available AMI, which may
      not be the latest.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Plan for instance replacement or update to the latest AMI.
    - Launch new instances using the latest AMI and migrate workloads as necessary.
    - Terminate old instances once migration is complete.
