    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and increase the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private and access
      is restricted to only authorized users mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure there are no
      public permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the bucket
      and account level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with organizational
      security standards.
