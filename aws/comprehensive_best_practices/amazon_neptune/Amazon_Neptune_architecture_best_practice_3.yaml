    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound access,
      which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it typically allows all inbound traffic. Ensuring instances are associated
      with custom security groups helps enforce the principle of least privilege.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the 'Security Groups' column for each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be launched with the default
      security group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance's requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with the instance and disassociate the default
      security group.
