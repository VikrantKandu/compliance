  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Public access can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      protect against accidental data exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can change
      this.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
