  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets set to public can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default minimizes this risk.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that public access is blocked and only authorized users have access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
  - Remediation:
    - For buckets found to be public, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket, go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block Public Access settings to block all public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and access control list to restrict access
      to only authorized users.
