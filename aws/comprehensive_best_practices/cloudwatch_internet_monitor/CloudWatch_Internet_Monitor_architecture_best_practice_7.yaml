    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings on the S3 bucket to prevent future
      public access configurations.
