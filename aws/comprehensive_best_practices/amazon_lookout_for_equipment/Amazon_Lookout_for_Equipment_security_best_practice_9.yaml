    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users with
      console access
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users with console access reduces the risk of
      compromised accounts due to phishing attacks or password leaks. Without MFA,
      an attacker who gains access to a user's password can log in and potentially
      cause significant harm to the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all users with console access.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under the 'Assigned MFA device' section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
