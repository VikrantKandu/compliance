    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check that the bucket ACL does not grant access to "Everyone" or "Any authenticated
      AWS user".
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure public access settings are
      correctly configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public
      access.
    - Enable the Block Public Access feature to prevent future misconfigurations.
    - Review and update any IAM policies that may grant public access to S3 buckets.
