    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, which
      helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly increases the security of
      AWS accounts by requiring additional verification beyond just a password. Without
      MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if passwords
      are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
