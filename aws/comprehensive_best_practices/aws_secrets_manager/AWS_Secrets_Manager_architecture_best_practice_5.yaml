    Title: Ensure IAM users have MFA enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM users adds an
      extra layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication beyond
      just a password. This helps protect against unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials being
      used to access your AWS environment. Without MFA, users are more vulnerable
      to phishing attacks and other forms of credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>' to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the steps to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
