    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible Only When Necessary
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required for business purposes. Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, increasing the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Limiting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and compliance
      violations, impacting the organization's reputation and resulting in potential
      financial penalties.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check the bucket policy for public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If public access is not required, update the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Modify the ACL to remove any public read/write permissions.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
