    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to
      their password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials and unauthorized access to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled,
      an attacker who gains access to a user's password can access AWS resources without
      additional verification, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      activities.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if an MFA device is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab, and in the Multi-factor authentication
      section, choose Manage.
    - Follow the steps to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
