    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDKs to check bucket policies and ACLs for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to the bucket.
