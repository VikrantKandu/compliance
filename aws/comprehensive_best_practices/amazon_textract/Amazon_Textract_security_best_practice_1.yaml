    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound traffic. Using non-default
      security groups allows for more granular control of inbound and outbound traffic
      to instances.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound traffic, which poses
      a security risk by exposing instances to potential unauthorized access. By using
      custom security groups, you can restrict access to only necessary ports and
      IP addresses, reducing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be launched with the default
      security group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with appropriate inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances previously using the default
      security group.
    - Remove the instances from the default security group.
