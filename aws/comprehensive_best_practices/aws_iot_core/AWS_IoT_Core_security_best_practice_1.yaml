    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. This involves disabling public access settings and
      configuring bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) appropriately.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets may lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information
      and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not allow
      public access. 4. Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled
      for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access, but settings
      can be modified by users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Update the bucket policy
      and ACL to remove public access permissions. 5. Enable "Block Public Access"
      settings for the bucket. 6. Review and update IAM policies to ensure they do
      not inadvertently allow public access.
