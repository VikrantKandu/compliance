    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps maintain data privacy
      and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block public access" settings
      are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for any public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
