    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, in addition to their
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA, an attacker who
      gains access to a user's password can access your AWS resources. MFA helps protect
      your account from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the specific user to enable MFA for.
    - Under 'Security credentials', select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
