    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading to data
      breaches.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, organizations can protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of data breaches.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each S3 bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to programmatically list bucket policies and ACLs to
      verify settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK to update the bucket settings.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access
      settings.
