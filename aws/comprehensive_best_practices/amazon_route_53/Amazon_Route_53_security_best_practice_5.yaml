    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining
      data security and privacy. Publicly accessible buckets can be easily exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Utilize the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure no public access settings
      can be applied.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to maintain compliance.
