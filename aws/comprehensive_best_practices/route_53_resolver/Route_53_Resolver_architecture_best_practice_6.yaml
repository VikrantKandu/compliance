    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible mitigates these risks and protects data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the "Permissions" tab. 5. Verify that
      "Block all public access" settings are enabled. 6. Ensure that bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Navigate to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all public access" settings.
      5. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
