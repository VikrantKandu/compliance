    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This check is crucial for
      protecting data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of accidental data exposure and enhances overall security posture.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      'Block Public Access' settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured to be so.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent public access.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
