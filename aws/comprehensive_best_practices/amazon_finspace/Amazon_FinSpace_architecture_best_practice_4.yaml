    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab for public access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust ACL settings to remove public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings on the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
