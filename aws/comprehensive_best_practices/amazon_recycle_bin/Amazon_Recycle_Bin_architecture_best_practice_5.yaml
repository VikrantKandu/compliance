    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in All Regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to log all account
      activity across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides a record of actions
      taken by a user, role, or an AWS service, which can be used for auditing and
      compliance purposes.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that you have a comprehensive
      log of all activities within your AWS account. This is crucial for security
      monitoring, forensic investigations, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
      Without CloudTrail, unauthorized activities may go undetected, increasing the
      risk of security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Ensure that there is a trail configured to log events in all regions.
    - Verify that the trail is configured to log both management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is disabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or update an existing trail to log events in all regions.
    - Ensure that both management and data events are being logged.
    - Save the trail configuration to apply the changes.
