    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity. Public buckets can be exploited to access or
      modify data, leading to security incidents and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have any public access permissions set in the
      bucket policy or ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy or ACLs.
    - Implement bucket policies and ACLs that restrict access to authorized users
      only.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" feature for the bucket in the AWS Management
      Console.
