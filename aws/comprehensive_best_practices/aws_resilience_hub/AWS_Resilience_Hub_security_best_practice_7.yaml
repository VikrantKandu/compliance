    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible, organizations can protect their data from unauthorized access and
      potential misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to block public access to the S3 bucket.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent accidental public
      exposure.
