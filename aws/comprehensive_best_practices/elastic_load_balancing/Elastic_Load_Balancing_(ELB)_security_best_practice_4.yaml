    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors to gain access to sensitive information or to distribute
      malicious content.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Check the "Permissions" tab and review the "Block public access" settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have all public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
