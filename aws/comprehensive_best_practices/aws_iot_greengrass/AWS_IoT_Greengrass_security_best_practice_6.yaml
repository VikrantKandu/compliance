    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      an additional form of verification beyond just a password. This helps prevent
      unauthorized access in case credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify MFA status programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the Security credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the steps to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
    - Ensure the user completes the setup process to activate MFA.
