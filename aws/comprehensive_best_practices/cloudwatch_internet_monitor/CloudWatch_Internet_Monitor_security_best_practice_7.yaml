    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 can be vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, especially if access controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Enable server-side encryption for each S3 bucket through the AWS Management
      Console or AWS CLI.
    - In the console, navigate to the bucket properties and enable encryption under
      the "Default encryption" section.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
      --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
      to enable encryption.
