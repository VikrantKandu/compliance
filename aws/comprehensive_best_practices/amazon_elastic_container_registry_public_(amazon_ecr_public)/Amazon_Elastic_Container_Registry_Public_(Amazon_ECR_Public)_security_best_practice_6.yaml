    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication in addition
      to a password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources
      by requiring additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing or credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for 'MFA Device' status.
    - Ensure all users have an 'MFA Device' assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' to assign an MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
