    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access.
      Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of data exposure and aligns
      with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME to check
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket ACL to remove
      public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
