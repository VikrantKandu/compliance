    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to manage access
      permissions.
