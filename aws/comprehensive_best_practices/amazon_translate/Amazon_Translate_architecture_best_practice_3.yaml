    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME' to verify
      the bucket ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME'
      and ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket ACL to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles as necessary.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to the bucket.
