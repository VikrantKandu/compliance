    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      access to sensitive data, data loss, and potential regulatory non-compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to review bucket permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and monitor for any unauthorized changes.
