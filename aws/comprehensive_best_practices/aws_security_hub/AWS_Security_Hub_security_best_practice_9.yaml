    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is critical to maintaining the
      confidentiality and integrity of data. Publicly accessible buckets can result
      in data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and permissions.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy grants public access and that the "Block Public
      Access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policies and permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket.
    - Modify any bucket policies that grant public access to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
