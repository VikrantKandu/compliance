    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption is a critical component of data
      security and helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps to protect data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data
      stored in S3 is vulnerable to being accessed by unauthorized users, which can
      lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, verify that server-side encryption is enabled by checking the
      "Properties" tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
