  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects data from unauthorized
      access and potential misuse. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to accidental
      data exposure, which could result in data breaches, regulatory non-compliance,
      and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to audit. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 5. Check
      the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled. 6. Verify the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure there are no public access
      permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs remediation. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab.
      5. Enable "Block all public access" settings. 6. Review and update the bucket
      policy and ACL to remove any permissions that allow public access.
