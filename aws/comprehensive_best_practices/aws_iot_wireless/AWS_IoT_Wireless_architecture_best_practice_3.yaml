    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and pose a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm there are
      no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to the
      bucket.
