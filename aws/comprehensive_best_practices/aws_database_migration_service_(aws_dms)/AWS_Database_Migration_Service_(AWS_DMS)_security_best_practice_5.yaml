    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance the security of the account. MFA adds an additional
      layer of protection on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account helps prevent unauthorized access.
      If the root account is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain full
      access to all resources in the AWS account, leading to data breaches or service
      disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select the root account.
    - Follow the instructions to enable a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Complete the setup process to activate MFA for the root account.
