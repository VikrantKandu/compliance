    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is configured for
      AWS IAM users to enhance account security by enforcing password complexity and
      expiration.
    Rationale: A strong password policy helps protect against unauthorized access
      by requiring passwords to meet complexity requirements and be changed regularly.
      Without a strong password policy, accounts are at risk of being compromised
      through weak or reused passwords.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the account settings for the password policy.
    - Verify that the password policy includes requirements for minimum length, complexity
      (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and expiration.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy, allowing
      users to set weak or simple passwords.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Edit the account password policy to include requirements for minimum password
      length, complexity, and expiration.
    - Save the changes to apply the new password policy.
