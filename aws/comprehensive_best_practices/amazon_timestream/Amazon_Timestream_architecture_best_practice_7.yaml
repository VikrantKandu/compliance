    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for public
      access settings. 4. Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name>' to check ACLs for public access. 5. Verify that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access using the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>'.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab. 3. Disable 'Block Public Access'
      settings if enabled. 4. Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements
      that allow public access. 5. Update ACLs to ensure no public permissions are
      granted.
