    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can lead to unauthorized access
      and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive
      data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Consider enabling "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future
      public access configurations.
