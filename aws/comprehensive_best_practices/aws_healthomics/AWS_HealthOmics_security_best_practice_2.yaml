    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks and enhances
      data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public
      access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
