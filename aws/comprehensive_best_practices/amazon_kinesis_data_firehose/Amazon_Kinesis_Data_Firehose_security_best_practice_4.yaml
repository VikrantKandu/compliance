  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that the user has on them, i.e., a device that can generate an MFA code. This
      significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against the unauthorized use
      of AWS accounts. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access to an IAM
      user's password can potentially access AWS resources and data, leading to security
      breaches and data loss.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the "MFA" column
      to ensure that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws
      iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify
      that MFA is configured for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab, and then choose
      Manage MFA. 6. Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device, hardware
      MFA device, or SMS MFA device to the user.
