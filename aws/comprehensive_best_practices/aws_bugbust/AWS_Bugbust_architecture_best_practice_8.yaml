    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an
      additional layer of security. MFA requires users to provide a second form of
      authentication, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of user accounts by requiring a
      second form of verification, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access due to compromised passwords. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
