    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      access only to specific users or services that require it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information to the public
      internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - Verify that no buckets are marked as "Public".
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any permissions that allow
      public access.
    - Consider enabling Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
