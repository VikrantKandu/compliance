    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using the Latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Regularly updating AMIs helps protect against vulnerabilities and exploits.
      Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to security risks and potential attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID used by each instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for your region.
    - Verify that instances are using the latest AMI version.
    Default Value: Instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified
      during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance to ensure compliance.
