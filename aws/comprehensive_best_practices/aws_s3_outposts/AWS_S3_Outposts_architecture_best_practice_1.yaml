    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive
      data and maintains compliance with industry standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Test the configuration to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
