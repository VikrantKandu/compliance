    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no buckets have public access
      unless explicitly required.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the ACL configuration
      for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review bucket policies
      for any public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from S3 bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
