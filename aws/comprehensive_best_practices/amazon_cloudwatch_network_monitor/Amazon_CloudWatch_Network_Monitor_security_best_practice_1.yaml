    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect against unauthorized data
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to retrieve the bucket's ACL and ensure no public access permissions are set.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
