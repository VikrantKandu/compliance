    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to data. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive information to the internet.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to exposure of
      sensitive data, which can have severe security and compliance implications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS API to list bucket permissions and verify that public
      access is not granted.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL, and remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
