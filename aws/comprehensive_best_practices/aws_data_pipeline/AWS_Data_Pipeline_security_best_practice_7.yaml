  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential security threats. Public buckets can
      expose data to the internet, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions of each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy does
      not allow public access. 5. Confirm that the "Block public access" settings
      are enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Modify the bucket policy
      to restrict public access. 5. Enable "Block public access" settings for the
      bucket. 6. Verify that the bucket is no longer accessible from the public internet.
