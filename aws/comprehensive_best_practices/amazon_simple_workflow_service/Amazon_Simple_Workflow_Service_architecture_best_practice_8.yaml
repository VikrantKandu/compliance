  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public
      access permissions set.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the ACL settings and ensure no public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket permissions
      to remove any public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings from
      being applied to your buckets.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with best practices.
