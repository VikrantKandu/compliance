    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition
      to the password. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly increases the security of
      your AWS environment by requiring additional verification. Without MFA, user
      accounts are more vulnerable to compromise through phishing or password theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically check for MFA devices associated with each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and choose 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam enable-mfa-device to enable MFA
      for users programmatically.
