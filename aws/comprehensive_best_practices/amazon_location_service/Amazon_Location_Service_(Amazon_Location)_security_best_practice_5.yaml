    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      restricting public access. Ensuring S3 buckets are private helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Keeping buckets private mitigates these risks
      by ensuring only authorized users have access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review its permissions.
    - Confirm that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are public by default unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
