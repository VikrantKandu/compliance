    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access, which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can expose data to the internet, leading to potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      ensure there are no public grants.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access.
