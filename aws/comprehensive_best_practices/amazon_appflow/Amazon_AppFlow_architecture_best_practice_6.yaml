    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list S3 buckets and check
      the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for public access permissions.
      Ensure that no bucket policy grants public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket
      policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions. Use the AWS Management
      Console or AWS CLI to update the permissions to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
