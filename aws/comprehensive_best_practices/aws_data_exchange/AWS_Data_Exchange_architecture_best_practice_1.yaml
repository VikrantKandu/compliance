    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to confirm
      the ACL settings do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
