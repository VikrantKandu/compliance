    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure compliance with organizational security
      policies and standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are provisioned with a known
      baseline of security and configuration settings. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities
      and misconfigurations that could be introduced by using unapproved or outdated
      AMIs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each running instance, check the AMI ID used.
    - Compare the AMI ID against the list of approved AMIs maintained by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances that are not using approved AMIs.
    - Stop the non-compliant instances.
    - Launch new instances using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate necessary data and configurations to the new instances.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instances after successful migration.
