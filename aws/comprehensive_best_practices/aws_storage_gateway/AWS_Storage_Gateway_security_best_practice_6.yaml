    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      and data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers
      to access or manipulate sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACLs and policies.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to configure bucket policies and ACLs
      to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access configurations.
