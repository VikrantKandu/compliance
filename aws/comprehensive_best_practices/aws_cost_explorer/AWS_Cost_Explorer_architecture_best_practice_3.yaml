    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data exposure in the event
      of unauthorized access or data breaches. Without encryption, sensitive data
      stored in S3 buckets can be easily accessed by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      BUCKET_NAME to verify that encryption is configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS KMS).
