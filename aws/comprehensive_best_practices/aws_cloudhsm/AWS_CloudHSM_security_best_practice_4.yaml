    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose data to the internet, leading
      to potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket has public access settings
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket's Access Control List (ACL) settings.
    - Review the bucket policy by running aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      and ensure no public access policies are present.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access settings
      by modifying the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket permissions and
      ensure that only authorized users have access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for all accounts and buckets to prevent
      future public access configurations.
