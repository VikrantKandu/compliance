    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is essential to protect sensitive information
      from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure,
      unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify bucket permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket's permissions, or use AWS
      CLI commands to update the policy and ACL.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access
      configurations.
