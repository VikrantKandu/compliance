  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on
      top of a password, requiring users to provide a second form of verification.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If a user's password is compromised, an attacker would still
      need the MFA device to gain access, significantly enhancing the security posture
      of your AWS environment.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Review the 'MFA' column to ensure
      that each user has MFA enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In
      the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow
      the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
