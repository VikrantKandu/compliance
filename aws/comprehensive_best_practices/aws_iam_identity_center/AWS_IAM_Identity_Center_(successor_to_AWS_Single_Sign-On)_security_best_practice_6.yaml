    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check bucket ACLs
      and aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is allowed.
