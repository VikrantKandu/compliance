    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to add an additional layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access, making it
      more difficult for unauthorized users to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against compromised credentials
      by requiring an additional verification step. Without MFA, if a user's credentials
      are compromised, an attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions
      and potentially sensitive data, leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to see if an MFA device is assigned. Users with no MFA device
      should be flagged as non-compliant.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
