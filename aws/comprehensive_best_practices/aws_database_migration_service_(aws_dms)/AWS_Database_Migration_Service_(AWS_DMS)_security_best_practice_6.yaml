    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Restricting access reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
