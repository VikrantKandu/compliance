    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates this risk and helps maintain data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that neither the bucket policy nor the ACL allows public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status to
      verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the settings.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" feature for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
