    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an
      extra layer of security to the AWS account. MFA requires users to provide two
      or more separate forms of identification before they are granted access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring not only a password but
      also a second factor, such as a physical device or an app, to access AWS resources.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially
      if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the username of the user without MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click on 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
