    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to ensure data is protected from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions of each bucket. 4. Ensure that 'Block all public access'
      settings are enabled for each bucket. 5. Verify that bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Enable 'Block all public
      access' settings for the bucket. 5. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs
      to ensure they do not grant public access.
