    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of the password, requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full control over the AWS account.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Check the 'MFA' column for the
      root account. 5. Ensure that the MFA status is 'Enabled'.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'My Security Credentials' section. 3. Select 'Activate MFA' and follow
      the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual or hardware MFA device.
