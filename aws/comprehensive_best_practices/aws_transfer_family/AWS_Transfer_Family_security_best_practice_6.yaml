    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      and that server-side encryption is enabled. This is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data stored in S3 from unauthorized access and ensuring data confidentiality.
    Rationale: Unrestricted public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and
      unauthorized data exposure. Enabling server-side encryption ensures that data
      is encrypted at rest, providing an additional layer of security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check their access policies to ensure they are not publicly
      accessible.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket by checking the
      properties of the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but server-side encryption
      is not enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Set the bucket policy to deny public access.
    - Enable server-side encryption by navigating to the bucket properties and selecting
      an encryption option such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
