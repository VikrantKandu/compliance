    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled to add an extra layer
      of security to their accounts. MFA requires users to present multiple forms
      of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the likelihood of
      compromised credentials leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, if an IAM
      user's credentials are stolen, an attacker can easily access AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' and follow the steps
      to enable MFA.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
