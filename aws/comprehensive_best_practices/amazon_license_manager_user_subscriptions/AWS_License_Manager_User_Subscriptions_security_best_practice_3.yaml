    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public access can
      lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the 'Access' column for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket is marked as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, log in to the AWS Management
      Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Edit' under 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the changes.
    - Review bucket policies and remove any statements that allow public access.
