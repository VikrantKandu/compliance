    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have their permissions set
      to private to prevent unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data exposure and security breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets set to public can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks, unauthorized data modification, and compliance
      violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions for each bucket. 4. Verify that the bucket does not
      have any public access permissions or policies attached.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 5.
      Remove any policies or permissions that allow public access. 6. Ensure the bucket
      policy denies public access, or use the "Block Public Access" settings to restrict
      access.
