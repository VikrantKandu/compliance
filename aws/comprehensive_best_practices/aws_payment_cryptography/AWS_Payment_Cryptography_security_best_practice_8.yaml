    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring a second
      form of verification, thus protecting the account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial as it provides a higher
      level of security. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the AWS account, and if compromised, it can lead to severe security breaches,
      data loss, and financial implications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account by reviewing the "Security Status"
      section.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the "Security Status" section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the provided instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or
      a hardware MFA device.
