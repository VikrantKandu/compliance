    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect sensitive AWS resources from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to data
      breaches or unauthorized use of services, causing potential financial and reputational
      damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the
      "Security credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use
      the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA devices for each user
      and ensure that each user has at least one MFA device enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. Under "Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)", choose "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual
      or hardware MFA device to the user.
