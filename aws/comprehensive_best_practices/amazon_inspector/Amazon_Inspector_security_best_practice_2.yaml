    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides data protection
      by encrypting your data before it is stored in AWS and decrypting it when you
      access it.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to exposure if accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties for the "Default encryption" setting.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," choose "Enable" and select the appropriate encryption
      method (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption to the bucket.
