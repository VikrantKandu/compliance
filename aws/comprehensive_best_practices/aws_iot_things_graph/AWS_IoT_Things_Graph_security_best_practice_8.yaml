    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires not only a
      password but also a unique code generated by a device controlled by the user,
      which helps protect the account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is crucial as it provides an additional
      security layer. The root account has full access to all resources in the AWS
      account, and compromising it could lead to severe security breaches, including
      data loss and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and then 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'IAM' service.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual or hardware MFA device.
