  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      thereby protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access to
      S3 buckets should be restricted to prevent data breaches and unauthorized data
      exposure.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to data leaks and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private
      by default helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that
      no buckets are set to allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the ACLs for each
      bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Modify the bucket ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
