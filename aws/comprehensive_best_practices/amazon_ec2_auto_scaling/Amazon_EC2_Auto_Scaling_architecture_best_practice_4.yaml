  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using approved AMIs helps maintain security and
      compliance standards across the organization.
  - Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities and compliance
      risks due to unknown software configurations and potential malware. Ensuring
      instances are launched with approved AMIs mitigates these risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. List all running instances and note their AMI IDs. 4. Compare the AMI IDs
      against the list of approved AMIs maintained by your organization. 5. Identify
      any instances using unapproved AMIs.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI available
      to the account.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances using unapproved AMIs. 2. Stop the non-compliant
      instances. 3. Relaunch the instances using an approved AMI. 4. Update organizational
      policies to enforce the use of approved AMIs during the instance launch process.
