    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect
      their AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised passwords and unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, users are more susceptible to phishing
      attacks and other security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list users with MFA devices attached.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device to the user.
