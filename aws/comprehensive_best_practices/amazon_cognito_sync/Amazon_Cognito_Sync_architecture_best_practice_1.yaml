    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default
      to prevent unauthorized access. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default minimizes the risk of accidental
      exposure of sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      if they contain confidential information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the settings of each bucket to ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access
      settings are enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that needs to be updated.
    - Click on "Permissions" and ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - If necessary, adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
