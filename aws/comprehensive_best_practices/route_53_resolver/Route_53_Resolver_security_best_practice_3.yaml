    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting access to only authorized users mitigates the risk
      of data leaks and ensures compliance with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket ACL and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access configurations.
