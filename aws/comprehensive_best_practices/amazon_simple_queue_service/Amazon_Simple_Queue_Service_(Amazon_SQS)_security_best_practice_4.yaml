  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block
      public access" settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies
      and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket. 2.
      Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
