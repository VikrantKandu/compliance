    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational
      damage. It is crucial to restrict access to only authorized users and applications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket to ensure they are
      enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict access to only authorized
      users.
    - Save the changes to apply the updated settings.
