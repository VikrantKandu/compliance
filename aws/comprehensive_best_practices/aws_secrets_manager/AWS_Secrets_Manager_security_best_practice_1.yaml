    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access and data exposure. This check verifies that S3 bucket policies
      and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private mitigates the risk of unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to sensitive
      data exposure and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check that the bucket ACL is not set to public-read or public-read-write.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to remove public-read or public-read-write permissions.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings.
