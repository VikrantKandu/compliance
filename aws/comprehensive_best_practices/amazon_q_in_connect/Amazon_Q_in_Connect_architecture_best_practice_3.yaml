    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Making S3 buckets public can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and potential reputational damage. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default helps maintain data security and compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: Execute aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and check
        for any grants that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public
      access is granted.
