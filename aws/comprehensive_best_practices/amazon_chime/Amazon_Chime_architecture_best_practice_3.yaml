    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are configured with server-side encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect sensitive data at rest. Server-side encryption
      automatically encrypts data when it is written to an S3 bucket and decrypts
      it when accessed, ensuring data privacy and compliance with security policies.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect against unauthorized access and
      data breaches. If server-side encryption is not enabled, sensitive data stored
      in S3 buckets may be exposed to unauthorized users, leading to potential data
      loss and compliance violations.
    Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets and check
      their encryption configuration. Verify that each bucket has server-side encryption
      enabled by checking the bucket properties for the encryption status. Alternatively,
      use AWS Config or AWS Security Hub to automate the detection of unencrypted
      buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: Enable server-side encryption for each S3 bucket by updating the
      bucket's properties to use AES-256 or AWS KMS encryption. This can be done through
      the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or by applying an S3 bucket policy that
      enforces encryption.
