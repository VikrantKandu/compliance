    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of your username and password. Enabling MFA for the root account helps
      prevent unauthorized access, even if the password is compromised.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS
      account. If compromised, it can lead to significant security breaches, data
      loss, and unauthorized usage of resources. Enabling MFA significantly reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to see if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam get-account-summary and verify
        that the 'AccountMFAEnabled' key is set to true.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Verify the setup by entering the authentication codes generated by the MFA device.
