    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
