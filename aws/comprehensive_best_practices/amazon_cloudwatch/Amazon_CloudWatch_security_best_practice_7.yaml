    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Step 4: Review the bucket's permissions and access settings.
    - Step 5: Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Action 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Action 4: Edit the bucket permissions to disable public access.
    - Action 5: Apply a bucket policy or ACL that restricts access to authorized users
        only.
