    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      additional authentication factors beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain complete control over the AWS environment, leading to
      potential data loss, service disruption, or financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and then "Security credentials" for the root account.
    - Verify that an MFA device is assigned and enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and then "Security credentials" for the root account.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and enable an MFA device.
