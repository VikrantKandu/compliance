    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to benefit from security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs may expose instances to vulnerabilities and security
      risks that have been addressed in newer versions. Regularly updating AMIs helps
      maintain security and operational efficiency.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the navigation pane.
    - Review the AMI ID used by each instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID against the latest available AMI IDs for your region.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may use older AMIs by default if not specified during
      launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify and note the latest AMI ID for your required operating system and region.
    - Plan and execute a strategy to update existing instances to the latest AMI,
      such as creating new instances with the updated AMI and migrating workloads.
    - Ensure future instances are launched with the latest AMI by updating launch
      configurations or templates.
