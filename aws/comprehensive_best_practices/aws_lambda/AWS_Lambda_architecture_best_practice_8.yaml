    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data leaks,
      compliance violations, and reputational damage. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings programmatically.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policy settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Re-evaluate the need for any public access and apply least privilege principles.
