    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of protection on top of a username and password, requiring the user to also
      provide a unique authentication code from their MFA device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker can
      easily gain access to the account. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      a second form of verification.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device". 7.
      Follow the prompts to assign and activate the MFA device.
