    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access
      to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access, even if the password is compromised. Without MFA, attackers can easily
      gain access to AWS resources using stolen credentials, potentially leading to
      data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>' to programmatically check MFA status
      for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
