    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves checking the bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private and access is restricted
      to authorized users mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings.
    - Implement bucket policies that restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets
      to prevent accidental public exposure.
