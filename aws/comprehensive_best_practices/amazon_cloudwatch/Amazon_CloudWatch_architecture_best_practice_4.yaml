    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      S3 buckets should be configured to restrict public access to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy'
      to check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable the 'Block Public Access' setting for the bucket.
