    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification
      step during login.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of protection to the root account,
      which has unlimited access to all resources in the AWS account. If MFA is not
      enabled, unauthorized users could potentially gain access to sensitive resources,
      leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section on the IAM dashboard.
    - Verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device,
      hardware MFA device, or other supported methods.
