    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      encryption at rest to protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information stored
      in S3 buckets from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without
      encryption, data could be exposed if access controls are bypassed or misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify that default encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check if encryption is configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab and enable 'Default Encryption'.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption option, such as AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3)
      or customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS).
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
