    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires
      users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password,
      which significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended to protect against unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could allow an attacker to gain
      access to AWS resources and data, potentially leading to data breaches or infrastructure
      misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA devices attached.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
