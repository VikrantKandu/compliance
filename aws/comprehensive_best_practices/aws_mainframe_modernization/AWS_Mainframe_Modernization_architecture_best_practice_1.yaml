    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have "Everyone" or "Authenticated Users" with
      any permissions.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure that all public access is
      blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
