    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks, compliance violations, and financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
