  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private by
      default to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Ensure that the "Block Public Access"
      settings are enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but existing buckets may
      have different configurations.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict public
      access. 4. Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket. 5. Regularly
      review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
