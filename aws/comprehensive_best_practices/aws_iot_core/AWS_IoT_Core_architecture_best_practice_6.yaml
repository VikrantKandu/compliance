    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and verify no public grants.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but specific configurations
      can override this.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and choose 'Permissions'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Remove any public access configurations from the bucket policy or ACL.
