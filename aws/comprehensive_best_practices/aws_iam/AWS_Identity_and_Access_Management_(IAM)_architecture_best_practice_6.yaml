    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Public access can be accidentally granted through
      bucket policies or ACLs, leading to sensitive data being accessible to anyone
      on the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. It is crucial to restrict access
      to only those who need it to minimize security risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that all public access
        is blocked.
    - Step 5: Review the bucket policy and ACLs to confirm that they do not allow
        public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the S3 bucket in question.
    - Step 2: Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 3: Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Step 4: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements
        that allow public access.
