    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings for each bucket and ensure no public access is granted.
    - Verify bucket policies using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> and ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' settings
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use AWS Config rules to continuously monitor and remediate public access settings.
