    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This security measure helps protect against compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA significantly
      reduces this risk by requiring a second factor for authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' and 'aws iam list-mfa-devices'
      to programmatically check MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the Security Credentials tab and click on 'Manage'
      under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA, using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
    - Ensure all users are informed and trained on how to use MFA.
