    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can
      protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and reduce the risk of data
      breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to
      access or delete data, leading to financial and reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access and the ACL is
      not set to public. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the bucket's policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Review the bucket policy and ACL settings for any public access
      configurations. 2. Modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
      3. Update the ACL to ensure it does not grant public access. 4. Implement AWS
      S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
