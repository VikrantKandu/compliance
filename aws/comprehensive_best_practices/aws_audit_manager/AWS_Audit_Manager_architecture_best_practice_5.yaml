  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have Password Policy
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: IAM users should adhere to a strong password policy to enhance security.
      This includes parameters like minimum length, requiring numbers, symbols, and
      uppercase letters.
  - Rationale: A strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized access to
      AWS resources by ensuring that passwords are difficult to crack. Without a strong
      password policy, accounts are more susceptible to brute force attacks and unauthorized
      access.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Account settings'. 4. Check the 'Password
      policy' section to ensure that a strong password policy is in place, including
      parameters such as minimum length and complexity requirements.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce a password policy.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Account settings'. 4. In the 'Password
      policy' section, configure the password policy to include requirements for minimum
      length, numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters. 5. Save the changes to enforce
      the new password policy.
