    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized data access. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are private helps protect sensitive data and comply with security
      best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' to verify the ACL settings
      for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy using 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy' to ensure no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL as necessary.
