    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure. Public access should be restricted unless
      explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service dashboard.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket permissions to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI to list bucket policies and check for public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Access the S3 bucket settings in the AWS Management Console.
    - Under the "Permissions" tab, ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to prevent
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies to restrict public access if necessary.
