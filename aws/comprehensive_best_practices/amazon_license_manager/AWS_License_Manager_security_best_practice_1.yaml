    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access means that anyone on the internet can access the data stored in
      the bucket, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure, which can have severe financial and reputational impacts.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled, either through bucket policies
      or ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Consider enabling the "Block Public Access" feature to prevent future public
      access settings.
