    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access to ensure
      sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. This includes checking
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not grant
      public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of data exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure all options
      are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access permissions
      set.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Remove any statements in the bucket policy that allow public access.
    - Update the bucket ACLs to remove any public access grants.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
