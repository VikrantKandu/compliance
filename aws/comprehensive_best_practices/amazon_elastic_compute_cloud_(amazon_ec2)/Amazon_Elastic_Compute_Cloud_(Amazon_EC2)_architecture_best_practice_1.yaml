    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard data by converting
      it into a secure format that is unreadable without a decryption key.
    Rationale: Enabling default encryption on S3 buckets ensures that all new objects
      are automatically encrypted, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Without encryption, sensitive data could be exposed if accessed by unauthorized
      users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if the "Default encryption" section is enabled and specifies a valid encryption
      method.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have default encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to configure.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable "Default encryption."
    - Choose an encryption method, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
