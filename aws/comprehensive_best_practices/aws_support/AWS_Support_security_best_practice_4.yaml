    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using approved and secure
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure compliance and security standards are
      met.
    Rationale: Using unapproved or outdated AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities
      and compliance issues. Approved AMIs are regularly updated and patched to mitigate
      potential risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Check the AMI ID of each instance.
    - Verify that the AMI ID is in the list of approved AMIs.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may be launched with any available AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan for instance replacement or migration using approved AMIs.
    - Launch new instances with approved AMIs and decommission non-compliant instances.
