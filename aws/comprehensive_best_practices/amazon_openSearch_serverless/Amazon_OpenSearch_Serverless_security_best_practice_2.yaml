  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  - Rationale: Encrypting data at rest in S3 buckets is critical for data protection
      and compliance with security standards. Without encryption, sensitive data may
      be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab. 4. Verify that the "Default
      encryption" setting is enabled and configured with an appropriate encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS). 5. Repeat the process for all buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs encryption. 4. Go to the Properties tab and
      enable "Default encryption." 5. Choose the desired encryption method (e.g.,
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS) and save changes. 6. Repeat the process for all unencrypted
      buckets.
