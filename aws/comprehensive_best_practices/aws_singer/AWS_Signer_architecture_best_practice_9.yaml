    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to provide two or more authentication factors to log in,
      increasing the security of the AWS account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, unauthorized users can gain access to AWS resources if they obtain
      account passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking at the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click on 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled.
