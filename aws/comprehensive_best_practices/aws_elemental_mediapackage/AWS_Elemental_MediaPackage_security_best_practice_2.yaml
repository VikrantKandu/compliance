    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      helps maintain data privacy and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and view its permissions.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings for the bucket.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' option is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to restrict public access to the bucket.
