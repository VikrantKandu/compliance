    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS resources. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all
      IAM users to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials by requiring
      an additional verification step during login. Without MFA, users are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device for the user.
