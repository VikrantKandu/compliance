    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data loss. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible, you
      reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure that all options are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure no bucket policy grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket's permissions
      to block public access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings in the S3 console for the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
