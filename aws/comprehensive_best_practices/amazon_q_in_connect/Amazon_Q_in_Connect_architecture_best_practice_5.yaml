    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by
      default helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each
        bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the ACL settings and confirm no public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but settings can be modified
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 5: Edit the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove any public
        access permissions.
    - Step 6: Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future
        public access configurations.
