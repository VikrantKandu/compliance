  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Public access
      can be granted either through bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs),
      or both.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential misuse.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access and that the ACL
      settings do not grant public read or write permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy
      to remove any statements that allow public access. 4. Adjust the ACL settings
      to ensure that public read or write permissions are not granted. 5. Consider
      using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
