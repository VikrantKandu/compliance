    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private to prevent
      unauthorized public access. By default, S3 buckets are private, but users may
      inadvertently make them public, exposing sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the Bucket Policy and Access Control List (ACL) to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify the bucket's ACL and policy settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings to ensure
      they are private.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access and review any
      existing policies that allow it.
