    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS resources by requiring
      an additional form of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
      due to compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with enabled MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose a user.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
