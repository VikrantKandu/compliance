    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce the
      risk of data exposure and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
      Public access to S3 buckets is a common cause of data breaches and can lead
      to significant financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that public access
      settings are configured to block all public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket_name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the "Block public access" settings and ensure all options are enabled to
      block public access.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
