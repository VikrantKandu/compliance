    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance the security of your
      AWS environment.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security beyond just
      a username and password. It helps protect against unauthorized access to AWS
      resources by requiring an additional verification step. Without MFA, compromised
      credentials can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled and cross-check with the list of all IAM users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
    - Repeat the process for all users without MFA enabled.
