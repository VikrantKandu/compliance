    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is essential to protect data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      exposure of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can change
      based on user settings.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be secured.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
