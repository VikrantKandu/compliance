    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides data protection
      by encrypting the data before it is stored and decrypting it when it is accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets
      could be exposed if accessed by unauthorized users or compromised through security
      vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the properties of the bucket to verify that server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check for the presence of encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the properties tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
