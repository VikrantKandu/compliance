    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by attackers to access,
      modify, or delete data. This check helps to protect sensitive data by ensuring
      proper access controls are in place.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to
      ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a public endpoint.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to prevent any future public access settings.
    - Save the changes and verify the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
