    Title: Ensure CloudFormation Stack Termination Protection is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudFormation stack termination protection prevents accidental deletion
      of stacks. Enabling this feature ensures that critical resources are not inadvertently
      removed, which can lead to service disruptions and data loss.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection on CloudFormation stacks reduces the
      risk of accidental deletion of critical infrastructure. Without this protection,
      stacks can be deleted by mistake, leading to potential downtime and loss of
      configuration.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select each stack and check if termination protection is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name
        <stack-name> to check the "EnableTerminationProtection" parameter.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stack termination protection is disabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select the stack for which you want to enable termination protection.
    - Click on "Actions" and select "Change termination protection".
    - Enable the termination protection option and save changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws cloudformation update-termination-protection
        --enable-termination-protection --stack-name <stack-name>.
