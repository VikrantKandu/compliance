    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS resources by requiring
      multiple forms of verification, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's password can gain full
      access to the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
        verify each user has an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
