    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security to the account. This helps prevent
      unauthorized access even if the root account password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because the root account
      has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. Without MFA, the
      account is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the password is compromised,
      which could lead to data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws iam get-account-summary and check the AccountMFAEnabled
        value.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' section.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device.
