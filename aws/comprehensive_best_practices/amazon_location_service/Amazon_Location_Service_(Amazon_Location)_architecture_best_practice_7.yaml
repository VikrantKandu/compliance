    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not use the default security group, which allows
      all inbound and outbound traffic. Using custom security groups with specific
      rules enhances security by limiting access.
    Rationale: The default security group allows unrestricted access, which can expose
      instances to unauthorized access and potential attacks. Custom security groups
      help enforce the principle of least privilege by allowing only necessary traffic.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and check the security group associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Update the EC2 instance configuration to use the new security group instead
      of the default one.
