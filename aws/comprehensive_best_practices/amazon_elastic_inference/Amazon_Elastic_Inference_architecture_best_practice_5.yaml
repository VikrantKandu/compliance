    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to user
      accounts by requiring not only a password but also a second form of verification.
      This helps protect accounts from unauthorized access, even if the password is
      compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to phishing attacks, password leaks, or brute force attempts. Without
      MFA, attackers can easily gain access to AWS resources if they obtain user credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate and configure MFA for the user.
