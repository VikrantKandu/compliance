    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: If S3 buckets are publicly accessible, sensitive data can be exposed
      to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      public access helps protect data integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Update access control lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
