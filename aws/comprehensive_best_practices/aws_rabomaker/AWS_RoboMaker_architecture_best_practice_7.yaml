    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation stacks have termination protection enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks have termination
      protection enabled to prevent accidental deletion.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection on CloudFormation stacks helps prevent
      accidental deletion, which can lead to data loss and service disruption. It
      is a safeguard against human error and ensures that critical resources are not
      inadvertently removed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select a stack to review.
    - Check if the termination protection is enabled for the stack.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation describe-stacks and
      verify the EnableTerminationProtection attribute is set to true for each stack.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is not enabled on new CloudFormation
      stacks.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select the stack for which you want to enable termination protection.
    - Choose the "Actions" dropdown and select "Edit termination protection."
    - Enable termination protection and save the changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation update-termination-protection
      --enable-termination-protection --stack-name <stack-name> to enable it programmatically.
