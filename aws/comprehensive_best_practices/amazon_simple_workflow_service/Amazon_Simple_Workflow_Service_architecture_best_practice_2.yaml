    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before they can access account
      resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because it provides an
      additional layer of security beyond just a password. Without MFA, if the root
      account password is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to all resources
      and data within the AWS account, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the root account.
    - Check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA using a supported device (e.g.,
      virtual MFA device, hardware MFA device).
