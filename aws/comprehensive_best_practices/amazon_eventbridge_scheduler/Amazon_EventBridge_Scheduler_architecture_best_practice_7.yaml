    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and reduces the risk of data leaks. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose data to anyone on the internet, leading to potential misuse
      or data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
