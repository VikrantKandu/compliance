    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      additional verification beyond just a password, significantly enhancing account
      security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even in cases where passwords are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force
      attacks.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Choose the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow the instructions to
      assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
