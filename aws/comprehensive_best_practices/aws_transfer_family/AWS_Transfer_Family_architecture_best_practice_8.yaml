    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be launched in the default VPC. Using a
      custom VPC allows for better network segmentation and access control, enhancing
      security.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in the default VPC can lead to security risks
      due to less restrictive network configurations. Custom VPCs provide more granular
      control over network settings, reducing potential attack surfaces.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'VPC ID' attribute.
    - Verify that the 'VPC ID' does not match the default VPC ID for the region.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched in the default VPC if
      no custom VPC is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new custom VPC with the desired configuration.
    - Stop the EC2 instance running in the default VPC.
    - Launch a new instance in the custom VPC using the same configuration and attach
      the necessary security groups and network interfaces.
