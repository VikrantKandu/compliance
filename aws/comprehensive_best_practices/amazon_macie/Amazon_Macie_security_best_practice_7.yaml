    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      and encrypted. S3 buckets are used to store data in AWS, and ensuring they are
      private prevents unauthorized access, while encryption protects data at rest.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and potential data loss. Ensuring privacy and encryption mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure it is not publicly accessible.
    - Verify that default encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically list bucket policies and encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but encryption is not enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Update bucket permissions to ensure it is not publicly accessible.
    - Enable default encryption by selecting a server-side encryption method such
      as SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.
    - Review and update bucket policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
