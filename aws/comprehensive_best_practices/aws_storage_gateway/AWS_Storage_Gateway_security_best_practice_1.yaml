    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to significant security risks,
      including unauthorized data access and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default protects sensitive information and complies with security
      best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket in the AWS Management
      Console.
