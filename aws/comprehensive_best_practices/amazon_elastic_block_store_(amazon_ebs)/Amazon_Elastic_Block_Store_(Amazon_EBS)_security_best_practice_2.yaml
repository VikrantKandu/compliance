  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and reduces the risk of data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets may inadvertently expose sensitive information, leading to compliance
      violations and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab. 4. Verify that the bucket does
      not have public access enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the permissions tab
      and review the bucket policy and ACL settings. 5. Remove any statements that
      grant public access. 6. Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the
      bucket.
