    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy Requires At Least One Uppercase Letter
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that your IAM password policy requires at least one uppercase
      letter to enhance password complexity and security.
    Rationale: Requiring an uppercase letter in passwords increases their complexity,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to weak passwords. Without this
      requirement, passwords may be more susceptible to brute force attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account Settings."
    - Check the "Password policy" section to verify that "Require at least one uppercase
      letter" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM password policies do not require an uppercase letter.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account Settings."
    - In the "Password policy" section, select "Require at least one uppercase letter."
    - Click "Save Changes" to enforce the policy.
