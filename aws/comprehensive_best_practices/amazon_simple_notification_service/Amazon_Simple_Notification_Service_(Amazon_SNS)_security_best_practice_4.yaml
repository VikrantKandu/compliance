    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Restricting public access helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket BUCKET_NAME to check the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure only authorized users have access.
