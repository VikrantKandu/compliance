    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to enhance security and network management capabilities.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides a secure and isolated
      network environment, allowing for better control over network configurations,
      such as IP addressing, routing, and security settings. Without a VPC, instances
      are more exposed to potential security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - Verify that each instance is associated with a VPC by checking the VPC ID column.
    Default Value: By default, instances are launched within a default VPC if no specific
      VPC is chosen.
    Remediation:
    - If any EC2 instances are found outside a VPC, migrate them to a VPC.
    - Create a new VPC if necessary.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance and launch a new instance within the desired
      VPC.
