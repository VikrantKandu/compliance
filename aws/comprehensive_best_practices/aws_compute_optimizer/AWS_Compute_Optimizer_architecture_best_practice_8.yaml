    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as they allow
      anyone on the internet to access the stored data. Ensuring buckets are private
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the 'Permissions' tab to ensure that
      'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Verify that there are no bucket policies
      or access control lists (ACLs) that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the non-compliant bucket. 3. Under the 'Permissions' tab, enable 'Block all
      public access'. 4. Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they
      do not allow public access.
