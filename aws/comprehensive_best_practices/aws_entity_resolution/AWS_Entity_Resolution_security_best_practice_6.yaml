  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that "Block all public
      access" is enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists
      (ACLs) allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the S3 service and select
      the bucket. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all public access"
      for the bucket. 5. Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public
      access.
