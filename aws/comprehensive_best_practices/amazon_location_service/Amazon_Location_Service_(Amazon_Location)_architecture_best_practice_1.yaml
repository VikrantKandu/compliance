    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data and maintain privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public
      access" is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket does not have public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
