    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to restrict
      public access. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly
      required, as this can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of inadvertent data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if not already enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
