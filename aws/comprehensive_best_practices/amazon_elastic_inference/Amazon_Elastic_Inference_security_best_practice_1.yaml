    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket is set to public.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each publicly accessible bucket, update the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update any bucket ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
