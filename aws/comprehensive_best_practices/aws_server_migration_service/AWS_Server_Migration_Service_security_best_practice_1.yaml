  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Verify that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Re-evaluate permissions regularly to ensure compliance.
