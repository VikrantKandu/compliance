    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks and potential exploitation by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that public access
      is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm that they
      do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Block all public access by updating the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
