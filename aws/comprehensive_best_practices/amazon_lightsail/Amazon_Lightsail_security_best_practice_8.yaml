    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. It is crucial
      to restrict access to only authorized users and services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If public access is detected, modify the Block Public Access settings to block
      all public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
    - Enable logging and monitoring to detect any changes to the bucket's access permissions.
