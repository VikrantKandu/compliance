  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to compliance violations
      and reputational damage.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with public access settings.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify the access settings for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to apply changes if necessary, ensuring all public access is
      blocked.
