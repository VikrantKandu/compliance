  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      public mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public
      access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if it is not already enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
