    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by
      requiring an additional authentication factor beyond the standard username and
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users provides an extra layer of security, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's
      credentials are compromised, an attacker can gain full access to the account.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to configure and enable an MFA device for
      the user.
