  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use server-side
      encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps to ensure that sensitive
      data is protected from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to being accessed by unauthorized users, especially if access
      controls are misconfigured.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled. 4. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is not compliant. 4. Go to the properties section
      and enable server-side encryption. 5. Choose the appropriate encryption method
      (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C) based on your requirements.
