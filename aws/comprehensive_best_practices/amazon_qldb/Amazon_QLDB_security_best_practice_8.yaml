    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed to the internet. Restricting access to only authorized
      users minimizes this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and update the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
