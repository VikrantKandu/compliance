  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that your Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be explicitly
      granted only when necessary and with caution.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Restricting access minimizes the
      risk of data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Block Public Access" settings.
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access and that the block
      public access settings are enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy
      to remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable 'Block all public access'
      settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
