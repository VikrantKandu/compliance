  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using approved AMIs helps maintain security and
      compliance by ensuring that instances are built from a secure and verified image.
  - Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities, as they
      may not have been vetted for security compliance. Approved AMIs ensure that
      all necessary patches and configurations are in place, reducing the risk of
      security breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Step 3: List all running EC2 instances.
    - Step 4: Verify that the AMI ID for each instance matches the list of approved
        AMI IDs.
    - Step 5: Document any instances using unapproved AMIs for further investigation.
  - Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify the EC2 instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Step 2: Plan for the migration of these instances to approved AMIs.
    - Step 3: Launch new instances using approved AMIs and migrate workloads.
    - Step 4: Terminate the non-compliant instances once migration is complete.
