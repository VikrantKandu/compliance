    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      (SSE) enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling SSE helps to ensure that data
      stored in S3 is encrypted and secure from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches. Without encryption, data
      stored in S3 is vulnerable to exposure and potential data theft.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. List all S3 buckets in the account. 4. For each bucket, check the bucket
      properties to verify if server-side encryption is enabled. 5. Ensure that the
      encryption is set to use either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that needs encryption. 3. Click on the Properties tab. 4. Under Default
      Encryption, choose to enable server-side encryption. 5. Select the desired encryption
      method (AES-256 or AWS-KMS). 6. Save the changes to apply server-side encryption
      to the bucket.
