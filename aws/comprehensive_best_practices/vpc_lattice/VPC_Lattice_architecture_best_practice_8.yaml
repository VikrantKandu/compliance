    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and do
      not allow public access. By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can modify
      permissions to make them public, which can expose sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      exposure of confidential information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
