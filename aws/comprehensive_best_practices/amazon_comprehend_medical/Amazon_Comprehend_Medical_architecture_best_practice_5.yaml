    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks and compromise the confidentiality of the stored information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements that allow
      public access.
