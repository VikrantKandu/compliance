    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the Access column for each bucket to ensure it is not set to "Public".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - For each publicly accessible bucket, update the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings.
    - Implement bucket policies that restrict access to specific AWS IAM users or
      roles.
