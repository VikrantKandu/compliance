    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      to your AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials,
      which can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without MFA,
      an attacker who gains access to a user's password can easily access AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
