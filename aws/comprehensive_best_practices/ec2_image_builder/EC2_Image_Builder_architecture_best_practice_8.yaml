    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by your organization. Approved AMIs are those that have
      been vetted for security and compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and compliance
      risks, as they may not have the necessary security patches or configurations.
      Ensuring the use of approved AMIs helps maintain a secure and compliant environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify that the AMI ID of each instance matches the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by your organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances that do not use approved AMIs.
    - Create a snapshot of the instance for backup.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Ensure proper configuration and data restoration on the new instance.
