    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. By default, S3 buckets should
      have public access blocked unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leakage. Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not allow public access by ensuring the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
