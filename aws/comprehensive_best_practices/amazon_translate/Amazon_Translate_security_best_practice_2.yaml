    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches or information leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps
      protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
