    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide not only their password
      but also a unique authentication code from their MFA device. This helps protect
      your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can
      gain full access to your AWS resources. MFA provides an additional barrier,
      making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your systems.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select each user and check if MFA is enabled under the Security credentials
      tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
