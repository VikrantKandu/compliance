    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are private by default, restricting
      public access unless explicitly allowed. This is crucial to protect sensitive
      data stored in S3 from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of accidental exposure of data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket ACL and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked unless
      explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is private.
