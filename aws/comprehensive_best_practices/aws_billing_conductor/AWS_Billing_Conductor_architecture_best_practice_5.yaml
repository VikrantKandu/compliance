  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default reduces the risk of unintentional
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches or unauthorized
      data access.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the "Public access" column for each bucket.
    - Verify that no buckets have public access enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access must be explicitly
      granted.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click "Block public access."
    - Confirm by clicking "Save changes" to ensure the bucket is private.
