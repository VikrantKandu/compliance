    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      minimizes the risk of accidental exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket unless there
      is a specific business requirement for public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and ensure they do not allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket settings to
      block public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to only authorized
      users.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings if public access is
      not needed.
