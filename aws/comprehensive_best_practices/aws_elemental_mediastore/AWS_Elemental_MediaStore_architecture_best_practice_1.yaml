    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data leaks and financial losses.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Review the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) to confirm they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs remediation. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab.
      5. Enable the "Block all public access" option. 6. Review and modify the bucket
      policy and ACL to remove any rules that allow public access.
