  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed.
  - Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you protect your
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive information, leading to compliance violations and
      reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the S3 console.
      2. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access. 3.
      Implement IAM policies that limit access to authorized users only.
