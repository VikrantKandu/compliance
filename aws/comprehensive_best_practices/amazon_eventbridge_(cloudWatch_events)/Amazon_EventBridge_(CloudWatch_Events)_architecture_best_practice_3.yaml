  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized data access. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and comply with data
      protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that 'Block all
      public access' is enabled. 5. Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public
      access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console and select the bucket. 2. Click on the 'Permissions'
      tab. 3. Enable 'Block all public access'. 4. Review and update the bucket policy
      to restrict public access. 5. Save changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
