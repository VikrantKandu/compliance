    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure that public access is not
      granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure that no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL settings to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
