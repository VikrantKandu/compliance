- rule:
  - ID: AWS-IAM-001
  - Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Set
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that an IAM password policy is in place to enforce
      strong password requirements for users. A strong password policy helps protect
      against unauthorized access by requiring complex passwords, password expiration,
      and password history.
  - Rationale: Implementing a strong IAM password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without a strong password policy, accounts are vulnerable
      to brute force attacks and unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches
      and other security incidents.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Account settings." 4. Verify that the
      password policy is enabled and meets the organization's requirements for complexity,
      length, expiration, and history.
  - Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Account settings." 4. Enable
      the password policy and configure it to meet the organization's security requirements,
      such as minimum password length, complexity, expiration, and password reuse
      prevention.
