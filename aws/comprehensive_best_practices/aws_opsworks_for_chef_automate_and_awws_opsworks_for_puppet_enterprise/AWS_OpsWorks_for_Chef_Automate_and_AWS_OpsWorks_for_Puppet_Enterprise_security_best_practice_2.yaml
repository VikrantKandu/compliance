    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this
      risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and block public access settings.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' option and save changes.
