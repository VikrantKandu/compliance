    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer
      of security to the authentication process.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials by requiring
      an additional authentication factor. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      in case user credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
