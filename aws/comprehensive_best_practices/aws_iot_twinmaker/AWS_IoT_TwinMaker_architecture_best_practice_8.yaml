    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile app.
      Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      by requiring an additional verification step. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker
      who gains access to a user's password could potentially access sensitive resources
      and data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the "Users" tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the "MFA" column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select the user.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA" and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
