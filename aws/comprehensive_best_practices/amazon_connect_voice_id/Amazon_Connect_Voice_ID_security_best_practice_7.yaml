    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects sensitive data from
      being exposed to the internet. Unauthorized access can lead to data theft, loss
      of intellectual property, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access permissions.
    - Verify that the ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" feature for the bucket.
