  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting access to only necessary users and services minimizes
      the risk of data leaks.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access (bucket settings)", verify that all options are enabled
      to block public access.
    - Confirm that no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Review the bucket's public access settings and ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - If public access is required, ensure it is documented and justified, and that
      only specific permissions are granted.
