    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling MFA for all IAM users adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring a second form of authentication. This helps protect AWS accounts from
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: MFA significantly enhances the security of AWS accounts by requiring
      users to present two or more separate forms of identification. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if passwords
      are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
        verify the status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user name.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
