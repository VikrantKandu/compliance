    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets are a common source of data leaks. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information
      and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions for each bucket. 4. Verify that no bucket has public
      access unless explicitly required. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically check the ACLs. 6. Check the bucket
      policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> for any public
      access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab
      and review the bucket policy and ACL. 5. Remove any public access permissions
      unless explicitly required. 6. Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent
      future public access.
