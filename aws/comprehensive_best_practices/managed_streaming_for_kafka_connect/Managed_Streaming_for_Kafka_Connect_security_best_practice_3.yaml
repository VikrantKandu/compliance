    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an extra layer of security by requiring a second
      form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has full access to all resources and services
      in the AWS account, making it a prime target for attackers. Without MFA, the
      account is vulnerable to password-based attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users' and then select the root account.
    - Verify that the 'MFA' column displays 'Enabled'.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users' and select the root account.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the root account.
