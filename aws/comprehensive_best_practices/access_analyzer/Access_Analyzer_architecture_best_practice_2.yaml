    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access ensures
      that only authorized users can access the data.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      and Access Control List (ACL) do not grant public access. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>` and
      `aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>` to review the bucket's
      access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon
      S3 service. 3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy and ACL. 6.
      Use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private` to set the ACL to private. 7. Update the bucket policy to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
