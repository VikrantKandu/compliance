    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps safeguard sensitive
      information and meet compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to exposure in case of misconfigurations or unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to its properties.
    - Verify that 'Default encryption' is enabled under the 'Encryption' section.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Default encryption', choose 'Enable' and select the desired encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
