    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure compliance with organizational security standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps maintain a consistent and secure baseline
      for EC2 instances, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities from unverified or outdated
      software configurations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: List all running EC2 instances in the AWS account.
    - Step 2: Identify the AMI ID used by each instance.
    - Step 3: Cross-reference the AMI IDs with a list of approved AMI IDs maintained
        by the organization.
    - Step 4: Report any instances using unapproved AMIs.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may be launched using any available AMIs by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Step 2: Create a snapshot of the instance for backup purposes.
    - Step 3: Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Step 4: Migrate the necessary data and configurations to the new instance.
    - Step 5: Terminate the non-compliant instance.
