  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance account security. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring a second form of authentication.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, an attacker with stolen credentials
      can easily access AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches and other
      security incidents.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to list users with MFA enabled.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In
      the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to
      assign a virtual MFA device to the user.
