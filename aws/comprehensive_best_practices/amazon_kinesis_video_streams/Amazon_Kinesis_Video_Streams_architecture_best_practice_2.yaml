    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that your Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to your data. Publicly accessible buckets can
      expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access. 5. Check the "Block public access" settings to
      ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Under the "Permissions" tab, modify the bucket policy to restrict public
      access. 4. Enable "Block all public access" settings. 5. Save the changes and
      verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
