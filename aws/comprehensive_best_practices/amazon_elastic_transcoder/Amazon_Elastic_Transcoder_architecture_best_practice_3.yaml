    Title: Ensure IAM Policies Are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are attached only to groups
      or roles, not directly to individual users. This practice helps manage permissions
      more effectively and simplifies the management of access controls.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures and potential security risks. By attaching policies to groups or
      roles, you can manage permissions more efficiently and reduce the risk of excessive
      permissions being granted inadvertently.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Policies" from the sidebar.
    - Review the "Attached entities" column for each policy.
    - Verify that policies are only attached to groups or roles, not directly to users.
    Default Value: Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles by default.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies that are directly attached to users.
    - Create or identify a group or role that requires the same permissions.
    - Attach the policies to the appropriate group or role.
    - Add users to the group or assign the role to users as needed.
