    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access to enhance security by requiring a second form
      of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
      due to compromised passwords.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA' is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
