    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in All Regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to log all account
      activity. CloudTrail provides visibility into user activity by recording actions
      taken on your account. This is crucial for security and compliance purposes.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that any activity, including
      unauthorized or malicious actions, is logged and can be audited. Without CloudTrail,
      it is difficult to track changes and access patterns, increasing the risk of
      undetected security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Step 3: Verify that there is a trail created with the option to apply to all
        regions enabled.
    - Step 4: Confirm that the trail is logging management events and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail service.
    - Step 2: Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Step 3: Ensure that the trail is configured to log both management and data
        events.
    - Step 4: Save the changes to enable logging across all regions.
