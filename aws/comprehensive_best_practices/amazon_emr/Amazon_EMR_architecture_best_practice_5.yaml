    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide more than one form of authentication. This check
      ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to phishing attacks and password theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, select Manage for Assigned MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
