    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles instead of directly
      to users. This helps in managing permissions more efficiently and reduces the
      risk of privilege escalation.
    Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      management and increases the risk of excessive permissions. By using groups
      or roles, permissions can be managed centrally and consistently, reducing the
      likelihood of human error and improving security posture.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Policies' from the left pane. 4. Review the 'Policy usage' column
      to identify policies attached directly to users. 5. For each policy directly
      attached to a user, verify if it can be moved to a group or a role.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation: 1. Identify the IAM policies directly attached to users. 2. Create
      or identify a group or role that can be used to manage the same permissions.
      3. Attach the policy to the identified group or role. 4. Remove the direct attachment
      of the policy from the user. 5. Ensure that users are assigned to the appropriate
      groups or have the necessary roles.
