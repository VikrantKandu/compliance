    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to provide a second form of authentication, significantly reducing the risk
      of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial for enhancing the security of
      AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's login credentials are compromised, the
      account is vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches
      and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA Device' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam list-mfa-devices' for each user to verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select a user and choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage' and follow the steps to
      assign an MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for each IAM user without MFA.
