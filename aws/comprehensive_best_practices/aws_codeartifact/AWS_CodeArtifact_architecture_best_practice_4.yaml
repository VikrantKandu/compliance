    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for IAM
      users. A strong password policy helps protect against unauthorized access by
      enforcing complexity requirements and regular password changes.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      user accounts by ensuring passwords are complex and changed regularly, thus
      providing an additional layer of security.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured to require at least:
      - Minimum password length of 8 characters
      - At least one uppercase letter
      - At least one lowercase letter
      - At least one number
      - At least one non-alphanumeric character
      - Password expiration and reuse prevention are also recommended.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Enable the password policy and set the required complexity options such as minimum
      length, character requirements, and password expiration settings.
