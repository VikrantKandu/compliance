    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your AWS account,
      even if a user's password is compromised. Without MFA, attackers can gain full
      access to your AWS resources using only a stolen password.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA enabled' column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA for the user.
