    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers to
      access or modify sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or access control
      lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status to check the public
      access status of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - For each S3 bucket, review and modify the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
