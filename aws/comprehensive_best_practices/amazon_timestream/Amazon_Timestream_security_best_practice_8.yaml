    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be easily discovered and accessed
      by unauthorized users, leading to potential data leaks and security breaches.
      Ensuring that buckets are private reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not allow public access by checking the "Block all
      public access" setting.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket, go to the permissions tab, and enable the "Block all public
      access" option.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      grant public access.
