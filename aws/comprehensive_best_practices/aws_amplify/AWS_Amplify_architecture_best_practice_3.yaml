  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data
      exposure, and compliance violations. It is crucial to restrict access to only
      authorized users and services.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious users
      to access sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
      issues. Restricting access minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each S3 bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that the bucket
      does not have "Public Access" enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 5.
      Disable "Block Public Access" settings. 6. Review and remove any bucket policies
      or ACLs that allow public access. 7. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is
      not publicly accessible.
