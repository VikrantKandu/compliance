    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can be controlled
      at both the bucket and account levels.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List" (ACL)
      to ensure they do not allow public access. 4. Verify that "Block Public Access"
      settings are enabled for the account and each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Review the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant
      public access. 2. Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the account and
      all buckets. 3. Remove any unnecessary bucket policies or ACLs that allow public
      access.
