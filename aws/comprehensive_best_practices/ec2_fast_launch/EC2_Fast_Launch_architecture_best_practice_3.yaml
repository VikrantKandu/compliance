    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and pose a security
      risk. By default, S3 buckets should have public access blocked.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public" access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the "Block public access" settings and enable all options to block public
      access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
