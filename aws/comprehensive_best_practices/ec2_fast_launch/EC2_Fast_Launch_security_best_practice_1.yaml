  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Secure
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check verifies that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      and have appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are private and secure is crucial for protecting sensitive data
      stored in AWS.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. By ensuring buckets are private and have the correct permissions,
      organizations can mitigate the risk of data leaks and comply with data protection
      regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review each bucket's permissions and ensure that they are not publicly accessible.
      4. Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they
      restrict access appropriately. 5. Use AWS Config or a similar tool to automate
      the detection of publicly accessible buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but permissions can be
      modified post-creation.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify any publicly accessible buckets. 2. Update the bucket
      policy to remove public access. 3. Adjust ACLs to ensure only authorized users
      have access. 4. Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
      to control access at a more granular level. 5. Regularly review bucket permissions
      to maintain security.
