    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data confidentiality and
      integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify that no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
