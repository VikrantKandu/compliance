    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. This check helps prevent data leakage and ensures that only authorized
      users can access the data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and public access settings do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Ensure that the public access settings block all public access.
