    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and security. This practice helps in controlling
      inbound and outbound traffic and enhances security by using security groups
      and network access control lists.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides an additional layer of
      security by isolating resources and controlling traffic. Instances not within
      a VPC may be exposed to the public internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Verify that each instance is associated with a VPC by checking the VPC ID in
      the instance details.
    Default Value: By default, instances launched in newer AWS accounts are within
      a VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not within a VPC.
    - Create a new VPC if not already available.
    - Migrate instances to the VPC by stopping the instance, creating an AMI, and
      launching a new instance from the AMI within the VPC.
