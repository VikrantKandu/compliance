  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should
      be configured to restrict access only to authorized users and applications.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions for each bucket. 4. Check if any bucket has public
      access settings enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket policies for
      public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Edit the bucket policy
      and ACL to remove any public access permissions. 5. Use AWS IAM to ensure only
      authorized users have access to the bucket. 6. Consider enabling S3 Block Public
      Access settings for additional protection.
