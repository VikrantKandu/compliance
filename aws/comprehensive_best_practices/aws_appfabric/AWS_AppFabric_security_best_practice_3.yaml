    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of verification,
      usually a code from a device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, which can lead to unauthorized access to your AWS resources. Without
      MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain full access to
      the account.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA
      device' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the 'Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the prompts
      to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
