    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication, such as a code from a mobile device, in addition
      to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized operations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices for each user to verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)', select 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
