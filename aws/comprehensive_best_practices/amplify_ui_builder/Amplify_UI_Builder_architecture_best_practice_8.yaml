    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and compliance
      violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
