    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as sensitive
      information might be exposed to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are not
      public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
