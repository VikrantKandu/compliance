    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to the
      AWS environment by requiring additional verification beyond just a username
      and password. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to protect
      against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources
      by requiring a second form of authentication. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select each user to check if MFA
      is enabled. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      Authentication section, choose Manage. 7. Follow the prompts to enable a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device.
