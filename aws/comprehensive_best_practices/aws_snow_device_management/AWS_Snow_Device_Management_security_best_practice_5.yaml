    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access, posing significant security risks. Ensuring buckets are private protects
      sensitive data and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Public' access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent public access.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
