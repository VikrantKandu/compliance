  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the
      risk of unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks and aligns with security best practices.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column to identify publicly
      accessible buckets. 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the
      "Permissions" tab, and verify that "Block all public access" is enabled. 5.
      Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      check for any public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. For any publicly accessible bucket, navigate to the bucket's "Permissions"
      tab in the AWS Console. 2. Enable "Block all public access" to prevent unauthorized
      access. 3. Review and remove any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs)
      that grant public access. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private to set the bucket ACL to private.
