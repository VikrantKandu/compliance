    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS resources. By requiring a second factor of authentication,
      it significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section for MFA on root account.
    - Under 'Users', ensure that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA device' column for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and click on each user to access their settings.
    - Under 'Security credentials', choose 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate an MFA device for the user.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users.
