    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard sensitive data by
      converting it into a form that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized people.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to data stored in AWS. Without encryption, data is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches, especially if access controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable default encryption.
    - Choose the desired encryption option, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
