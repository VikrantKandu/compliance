    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification, enhancing account protection.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps prevent unauthorized access,
      even if the root account password is compromised. The root account has unrestricted
      access to your AWS resources, and its compromise can lead to severe security
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the root account and check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security Credentials'
      tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to activate MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device.
