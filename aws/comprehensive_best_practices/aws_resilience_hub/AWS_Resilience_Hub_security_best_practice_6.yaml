    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all IAM users
      to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide a second form
      of authentication, enhancing the protection of AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' and 'aws iam list-mfa-devices'
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the username for which you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
