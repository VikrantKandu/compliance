    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private to prevent
      unauthorized access. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly
      required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Check the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
