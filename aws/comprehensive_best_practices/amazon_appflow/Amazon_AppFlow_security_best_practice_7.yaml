    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should
      not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required for business purposes.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private protects
      against accidental data exposure and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify the ACL settings
      for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket ACL to remove public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users or roles.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to manage access
      control.
