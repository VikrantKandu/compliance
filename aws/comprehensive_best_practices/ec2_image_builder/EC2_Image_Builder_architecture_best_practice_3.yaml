    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This security check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks, compliance violations, and potential financial
      loss. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the ACL does not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any bucket that is publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to remove
      any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACL to ensure it does not allow public read or write access.
    - Consider enabling the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent
      future misconfigurations.
