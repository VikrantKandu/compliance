    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI to list bucket policies and ensure no public access
      policies are applied.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
