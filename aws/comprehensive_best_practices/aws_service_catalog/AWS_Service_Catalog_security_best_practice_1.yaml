    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS accounts by requiring not only a password but also a second
      form of verification. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access if credentials
      are compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides additional security beyond just a password, which
      can be guessed or stolen. Without MFA, unauthorized users can potentially gain
      access to sensitive resources and data, leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
