    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is allowed.
