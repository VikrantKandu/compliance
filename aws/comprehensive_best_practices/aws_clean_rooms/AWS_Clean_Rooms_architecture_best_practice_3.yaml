    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to deny public
      access. Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but public access can be granted
      through specific permissions.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent unauthorized access.
