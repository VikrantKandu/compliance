    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to present two or more verification factors
      to gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, especially in scenarios where user credentials might
      be compromised. Without MFA, attackers can easily gain access using stolen credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if an MFA device is assigned under the "Security Credentials"
      tab.
    - Ensure that all users have an MFA device enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user to whom you want to assign MFA.
    - In the "Security Credentials" tab, click on "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
