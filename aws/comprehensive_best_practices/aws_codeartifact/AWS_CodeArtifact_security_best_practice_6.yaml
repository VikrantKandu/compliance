    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet.
      Restricting access to authorized users reduces the risk of data breaches and
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no buckets have public access
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check bucket policies using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name>
      to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL.
    - Update bucket policies to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets
      to prevent future public access.
