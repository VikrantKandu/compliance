    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to deny public access.
      This prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and ensure there are no public grants.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can change these
      settings.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
