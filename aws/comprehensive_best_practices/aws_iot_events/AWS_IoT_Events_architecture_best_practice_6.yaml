    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to confirm they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements allowing public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
