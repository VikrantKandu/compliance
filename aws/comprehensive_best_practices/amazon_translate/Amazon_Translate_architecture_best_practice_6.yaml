    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that your Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive data and maintain
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
