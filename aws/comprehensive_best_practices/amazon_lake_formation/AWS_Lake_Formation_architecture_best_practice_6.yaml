    Title: Ensure EC2 instances have a security group attached
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances have at least one security
      group attached to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups act
      as a virtual firewall to control traffic to one or more instances.
    Rationale: Attaching security groups to EC2 instances is crucial for controlling
      access and ensuring that only authorized traffic can reach the instances. Without
      security groups, instances may be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to
      potential data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security Groups' column to ensure there is at
      least one security group attached.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances are launched with a security group
      attached.
    Remediation:
    - If an instance does not have a security group attached, navigate to the EC2
      dashboard.
    - Select the instance without a security group.
    - Choose 'Actions', then 'Networking', and 'Change Security Groups'.
    - Attach an appropriate security group to the instance.
