    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of data leaks
      and maintains data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to verify that the bucket does not
      have public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME to verify
      the ACL settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies do not grant public access by reviewing the policy
      JSON.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove the public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific AWS IAM users or roles.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings.
