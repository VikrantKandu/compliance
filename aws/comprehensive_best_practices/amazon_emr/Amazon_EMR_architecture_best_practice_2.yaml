    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet, leading to potential data leaks
      and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible protects
      against accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to confirm that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - In the AWS Management Console, go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
