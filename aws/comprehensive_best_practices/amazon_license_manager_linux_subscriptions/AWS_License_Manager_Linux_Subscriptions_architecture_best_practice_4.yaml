    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can
      lead to data breaches and leakage of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users. This can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and
      loss of customer trust. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI commands to update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access.
