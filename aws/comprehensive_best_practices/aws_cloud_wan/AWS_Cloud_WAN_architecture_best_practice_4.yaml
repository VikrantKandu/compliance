    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      or tampering.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, data loss, or unauthorized data modifications.
      Ensuring buckets are not public helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      specific users or roles.
