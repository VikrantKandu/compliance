    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk by
      allowing anyone on the internet to access potentially sensitive data. This can
      lead to data leaks, compliance issues, and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket listed.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>
      to check ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
