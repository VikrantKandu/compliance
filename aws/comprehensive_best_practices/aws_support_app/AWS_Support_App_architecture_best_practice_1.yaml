    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Restricting access helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with a "Public" access status.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure all options are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access," click "Edit."
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
