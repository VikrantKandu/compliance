    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, as it requires a second form of verification in addition to the
      password. This is crucial for protecting sensitive AWS resources and preventing
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" and review the MFA column for each user.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all users listed.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" under the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
