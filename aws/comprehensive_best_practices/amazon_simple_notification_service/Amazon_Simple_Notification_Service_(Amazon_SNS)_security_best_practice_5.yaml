    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have 'Block Public Access'
      settings enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' on all S3 buckets.
    - Review and update bucket policies to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
