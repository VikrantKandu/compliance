    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data, resulting in data breaches, compliance violations, and financial
      loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all
      public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' under 'Block public access settings for this
      bucket'.
