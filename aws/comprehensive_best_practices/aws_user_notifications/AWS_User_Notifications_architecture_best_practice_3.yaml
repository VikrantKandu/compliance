  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by the organization. Using approved AMIs ensures that
      instances are configured with the necessary security patches and configurations.
  - Rationale: Approved AMIs are vetted for security and compliance standards. Using
      unapproved AMIs may introduce vulnerabilities, outdated software, or misconfigurations
      that could lead to security breaches or non-compliance with organizational policies.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. List all running EC2 instances and note their AMI IDs. 4. Compare the AMI
      IDs against the list of approved AMIs maintained by the organization. 5. Ensure
      all instances are using AMIs from the approved list.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any AMI available
      to the user.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances that are not using approved AMIs. 2. Create
      a new AMI from an approved base image with the necessary configurations. 3.
      Plan for migration of the non-compliant instances to new instances using the
      approved AMI. 4. Terminate the non-compliant instances once the migration is
      complete.
