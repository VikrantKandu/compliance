    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by your organization. Approved AMIs are typically those
      that have been hardened and meet security and compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities and compliance
      issues as they may not be configured to meet your organization's standards.
      Approved AMIs help maintain a secure and consistent environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Review the list of running instances and their associated AMIs.
    - Verify that each instance is using an AMI from the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by your organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any publicly available
      or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Create a snapshot of the instance's current state if necessary.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI, ensuring it is configured with
      the necessary security groups and IAM roles.
