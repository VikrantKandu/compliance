    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions by selecting each bucket and checking the 'Permissions'
      tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Ensure
      that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket you want to modify. 3. Click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure
      that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled. 5. Review and modify the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove any public access configurations.
