    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and non-compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open its properties.
    - Check the "Permissions" tab to verify that public access settings are configured
      to block public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the bucket's ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and edit the "Block public access" settings to enable
      all options.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
