    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate pieces of evidence to authenticate, thereby reducing the
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to an AWS account. If compromised,
      it could lead to severe security breaches, including data loss and unauthorized
      resource manipulation. Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA for the root account under the 'Security Status' section.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled and configured correctly.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Select 'Activate MFA' on the root account.
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA setup by entering the authentication code generated by the MFA
      device.
