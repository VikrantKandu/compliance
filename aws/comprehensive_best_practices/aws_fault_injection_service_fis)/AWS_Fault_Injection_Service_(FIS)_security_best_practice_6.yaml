    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional authentication
      information beyond their password. This helps protect the account from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts, especially if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to attacks, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the steps to assign an MFA device to the user.
