  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of data exposure and aligns with security best practices.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket's permissions and ensure that
      'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket does not have public read or
      write permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not accessible to the public.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access' to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible. 6. Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public
      access.
