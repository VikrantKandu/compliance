    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS account access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS
      resources if a user's credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the presence of an MFA device
      in the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to set up an MFA device.
