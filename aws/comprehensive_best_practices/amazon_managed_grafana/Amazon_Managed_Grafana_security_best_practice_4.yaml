    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts by requiring a second form
      of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of verification. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," choose "Manage" and follow the instructions to
      enable MFA.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam enable-mfa-device to enable
        MFA for a user.
