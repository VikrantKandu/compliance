    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
      It is crucial to ensure that only authorized users have access to the data stored
      in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and review the permissions under the "Permissions" tab. 4.
      Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Ensure that the
      "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Under the "Permissions" tab, review
      the bucket policy and remove any statements that allow public access. 4. Enable
      the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
      5. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
