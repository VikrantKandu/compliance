    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should have proper access controls
      to ensure that data is only accessible to authorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that no bucket is set to public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to run 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      verify ACL settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket's permissions to remove any public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
