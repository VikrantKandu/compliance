    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access. Restricting public access
      reduces the risk of data exposure and enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    - Check bucket policies for statements that allow public access using the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
