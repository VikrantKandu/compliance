    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, inspect the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Ensure that no bucket policy grants public access and that the ACL does not
      allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs to verify
      settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy or ACL.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket no longer allows public access.
