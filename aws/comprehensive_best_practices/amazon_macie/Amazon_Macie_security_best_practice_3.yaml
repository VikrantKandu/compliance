    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group to prevent unrestricted access. Default security groups allow all inbound
      and outbound traffic, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unauthorized
      access and potential attacks. By ensuring EC2 instances are associated with
      custom security groups, you can enforce stricter access controls and reduce
      security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the 'Instances' option from the left-hand menu.
    - Review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group if
      not specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the 'Instances' option from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance using the default security group, select the instance and
      choose 'Actions'.
    - Click on 'Networking' and then 'Change Security Groups'.
    - Select a custom security group with appropriate rules and apply the changes.
    - Ensure that the default security group is modified to restrict all inbound and
      outbound traffic if it is not used.
