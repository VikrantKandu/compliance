    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      ensuring that sensitive data is not publicly accessible. S3 buckets should have
      access policies that restrict access to only authorized users and services.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to
      data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and check the "Access" column for any buckets marked
      as "Public". 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its permissions.
      5. Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow
      public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check ACL settings programmatically. 7. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy
      for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access statements. 2. Modify the bucket's ACL to remove any
      public access grants. 3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future
      public access configurations. 4. Re-audit the bucket to ensure compliance.
