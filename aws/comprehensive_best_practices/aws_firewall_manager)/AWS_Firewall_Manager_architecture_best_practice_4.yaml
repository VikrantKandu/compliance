    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within them. S3 buckets
      should be configured to restrict access only to authorized users and services.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. By ensuring buckets are private, you mitigate the risk of sensitive
      data being accessed by unauthorized parties.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Apply bucket policies that restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
    - Use AWS Trusted Advisor or Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to identify
      and block public access to S3 buckets.
