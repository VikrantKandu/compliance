    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps to secure
      AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      can gain full access to the AWS account, potentially leading to data breaches
      or unauthorized resource usage. MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, verify that the MFA column displays a device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication (MFA) section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
