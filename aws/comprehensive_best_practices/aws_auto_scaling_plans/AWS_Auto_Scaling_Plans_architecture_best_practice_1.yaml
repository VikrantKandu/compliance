    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, a compromised password could allow an attacker to access
      your AWS account and make unauthorized changes.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Users' section.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Users' section.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
