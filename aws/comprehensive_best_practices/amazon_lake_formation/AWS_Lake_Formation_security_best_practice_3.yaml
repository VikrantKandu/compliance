    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using Amazon Machine Images
      (AMIs) that have been approved by the organization. Using approved AMIs ensures
      that instances comply with security and operational requirements.
    Rationale: Approved AMIs are vetted to meet security and compliance standards.
      Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and non-compliance risks,
      potentially leading to data breaches or operational failures.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Review the list of running instances and note their AMI IDs.
    - Compare these AMI IDs against the list of approved AMIs maintained by the organization.
    - Ensure that all running instances are using AMIs that are on the approved list.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI, including those not
      approved by the organization.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances running with unapproved AMIs.
    - Stop the non-compliant instances.
    - Relaunch instances using approved AMIs.
    - Update organizational policies to restrict AMI usage to approved images only.
