    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and
      compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to run aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status and aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      to check for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Implement IAM policies that restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
