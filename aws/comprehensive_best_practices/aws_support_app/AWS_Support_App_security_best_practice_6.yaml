  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, potentially leading to data leaks, unauthorized data manipulation,
      or deletion. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive data and maintain
      privacy and security.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
      4. Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not grant public access. 5. Use
      the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list all buckets and check the Block Public Access
      settings.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Enable Block Public
      Access settings for the bucket. 5. Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs
      to ensure no public access is allowed. 6. Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to automate
      the application of Block Public Access settings across all buckets.
