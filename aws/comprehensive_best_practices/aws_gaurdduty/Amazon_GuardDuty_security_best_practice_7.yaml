    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to the public internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Access' column in the bucket list to identify any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the 'Permissions' tab, and
      verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' feature in S3 to prevent future public access
      configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
