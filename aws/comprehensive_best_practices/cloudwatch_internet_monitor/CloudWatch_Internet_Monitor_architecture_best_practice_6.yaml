    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security
      to user accounts. MFA requires users to provide a second form of authentication,
      typically a temporary code from a device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring a second factor of authentication,
      reducing the risk of compromised accounts. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains
      a user's password could gain unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - For each user, click on the user's name to view their details.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage MFA device" and follow the
      instructions to enable MFA.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to enable MFA for users programmatically.
