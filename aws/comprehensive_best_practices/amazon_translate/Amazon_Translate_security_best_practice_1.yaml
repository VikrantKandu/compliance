    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of identification,
      in addition to their password, when signing in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, unauthorized access
      could lead to data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, confirm that 'MFA' is enabled under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
