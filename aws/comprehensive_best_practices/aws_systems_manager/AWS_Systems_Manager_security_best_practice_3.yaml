  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should
      be restricted unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Restricting access helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its properties. 4. Check
      the 'Permissions' tab to ensure that the bucket does not have 'Public Access'
      enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to programmatically verify that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block
      public access' settings. 4. Enable 'Block all public access' if not already
      enabled. 5. Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public
      access is permitted unless required.
