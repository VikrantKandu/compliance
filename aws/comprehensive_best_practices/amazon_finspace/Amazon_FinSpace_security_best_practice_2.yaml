    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. This best practice recommends configuring S3 bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users and pose significant security risks, including data theft and compliance
      violations. Restricting public access helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to audit. 4. Check the bucket permissions for
      any public access settings. 5. Review the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure no
      public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon
      S3 service. 3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Click on the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Edit the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      6. Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
