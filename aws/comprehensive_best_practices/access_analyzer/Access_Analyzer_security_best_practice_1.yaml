    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access
      to AWS resources. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is compromised, an attacker can gain full access to the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-users` followed by `aws
      iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>` for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate the MFA device.
