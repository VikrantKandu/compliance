    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have Multi-Factor Authentication Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, which helps protect
      against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the account's resources. MFA adds a layer
      of security by requiring a second factor, such as a physical device or app,
      making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each user to verify if MFA devices
      are assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled to comply with this best practice.
