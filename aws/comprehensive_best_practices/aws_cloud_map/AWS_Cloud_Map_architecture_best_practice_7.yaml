    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Confirm that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket ACL.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
