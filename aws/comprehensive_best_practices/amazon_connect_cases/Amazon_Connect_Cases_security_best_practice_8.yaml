    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unintended data exposure,
      resulting in potential data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
