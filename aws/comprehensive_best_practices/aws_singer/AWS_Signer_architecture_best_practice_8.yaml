    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a password, requiring a second
      form of verification to access the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users mitigates the risk of unauthorized access
      due to compromised credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen,
      an attacker can easily gain access to AWS resources, potentially leading to
      data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Click on 'Security credentials'.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage' and follow the steps to
      assign an MFA device.
