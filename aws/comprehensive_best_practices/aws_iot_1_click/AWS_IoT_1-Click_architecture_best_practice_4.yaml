    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Check the Access Control List (ACL) to confirm it does not grant public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies that grant public access.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure there are no public permissions granted.
