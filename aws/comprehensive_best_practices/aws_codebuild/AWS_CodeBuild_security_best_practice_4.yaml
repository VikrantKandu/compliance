  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' option is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
