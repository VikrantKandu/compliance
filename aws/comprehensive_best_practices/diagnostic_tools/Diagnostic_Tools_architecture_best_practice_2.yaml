  - ID: AWS-S3-01
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should have appropriate permissions
      set to limit access to authorized users or services only.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as unauthorized
      users can access and potentially modify sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are
      private mitigates the risk of data exposure and unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions. 4. Check the 'Block Public
      Access' settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on 'Permissions' and enable
      'Block all public access'. 4. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to
      remove any public access permissions. 5. Save changes and re-evaluate the bucket's
      access settings.
