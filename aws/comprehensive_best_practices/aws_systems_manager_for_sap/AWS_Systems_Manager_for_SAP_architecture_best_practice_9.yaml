    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data manipulation.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify publicly accessible buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
