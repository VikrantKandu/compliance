    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are not associated with
      the default security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound
      access, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to unintended exposure of EC2
      instances to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches. Custom security groups should be used to define specific inbound
      and outbound traffic rules.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched using the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that meet
      your security requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Remove the default security group association from the instances.
