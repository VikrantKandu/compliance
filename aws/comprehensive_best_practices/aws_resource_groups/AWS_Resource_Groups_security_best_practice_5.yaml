  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
  - Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial for protecting
      sensitive data stored in the cloud. Without encryption, data is vulnerable to
      unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of buckets and verify that server-side encryption is
        enabled for each bucket by checking the properties.
    - Step 4: Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
        to programmatically verify encryption settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Step 3: Go to the properties of the bucket and enable server-side encryption,
        choosing the appropriate encryption key.
    - Step 4: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption
        --bucket <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
        to enable encryption.
