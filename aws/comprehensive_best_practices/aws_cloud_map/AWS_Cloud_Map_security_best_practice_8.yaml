    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that an IAM password policy is enabled and configured to enforce
      strong password requirements for user accounts. This includes setting minimum
      password length, requiring specific character types, and enforcing password
      expiration.
    Rationale: A strong password policy helps protect AWS resources by ensuring that
      user passwords are difficult to guess or crack. Without a strong password policy,
      accounts may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, leading to potential data
      breaches and security incidents.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'. 4. Verify that a
      password policy is enabled and configured with minimum password length, character
      requirements, and expiration settings.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'. 4. Click
      'Set password policy' and configure the policy with strong password requirements,
      including minimum length, character types, and expiration settings. 5. Save
      the changes to enforce the new password policy.
