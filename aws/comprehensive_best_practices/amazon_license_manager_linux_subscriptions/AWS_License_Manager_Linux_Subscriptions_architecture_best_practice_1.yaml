    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional verification
      beyond their password. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users
      to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      full access to the user's permissions and potentially the entire AWS environment,
      leading to data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <user-name> for each user to verify MFA devices
      are configured.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and choose 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device for the user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to enable MFA by creating and associating a virtual
      MFA device with each user.
