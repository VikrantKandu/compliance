    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring users to provide two forms of identification.
      This best practice ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to enhance account
      security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts
      by requiring an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, accounts are
      vulnerable to compromise through password theft or guessing.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the "Users" section to list all IAM users.
    - Verify that each user has MFA enabled by checking the "MFA" column.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and choose "Security credentials."
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage" and follow the steps to
      assign an MFA device.
