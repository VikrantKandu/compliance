    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection on
      top of the username and password, requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access by
      requiring an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, user accounts are
      more vulnerable to phishing attacks and credential theft, which can lead to
      unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA enabled" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
      to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the Security credentials tab, click on Manage for the Assigned MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
