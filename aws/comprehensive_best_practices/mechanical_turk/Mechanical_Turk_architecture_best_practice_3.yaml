    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encrypting data helps prevent
      unauthorized access and secures sensitive information.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access. Encryption adds an additional layer of security, protecting
      data from potential breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the default encryption settings. 4. Verify that server-side
      encryption (SSE) is enabled with either SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to configure. 4. Go to the "Properties" tab. 5.
      Under "Default Encryption," choose "Edit." 6. Select the desired encryption
      method (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C). 7. Save the changes to enable server-side
      encryption.
