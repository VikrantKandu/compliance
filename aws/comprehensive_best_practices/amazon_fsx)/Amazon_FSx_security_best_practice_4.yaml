  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and security breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private protects data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and public access settings.
      4. Ensure that the bucket does not have public read or write access unless explicitly
      required. 5. Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do
      not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Review the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not allow public
      access. 2. Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access
      to the bucket. 3. If public access is necessary, apply the principle of least
      privilege to limit access to only what is required.
