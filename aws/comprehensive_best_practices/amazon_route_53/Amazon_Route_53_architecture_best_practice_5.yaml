    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances do not have security group
      rules that allow unrestricted inbound access from the internet. Publicly accessible
      instances can be vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks.
    Rationale: Allowing unrestricted access to EC2 instances can lead to security
      breaches, unauthorized data access, and potential compromise of the instance.
      Restricting access to specific IP addresses or ranges reduces the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Check the security groups associated with each EC2 instance.
    - Ensure that no security group has inbound rules allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0
      on any port.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may have security groups that allow inbound
      access from the internet.
    Remediation:
    - Review the security groups associated with EC2 instances.
    - Modify inbound rules to restrict access to specific IP addresses or ranges.
    - Remove any rules that allow inbound access from 0.0.0.0/0 unless absolutely
      necessary and properly secured.
