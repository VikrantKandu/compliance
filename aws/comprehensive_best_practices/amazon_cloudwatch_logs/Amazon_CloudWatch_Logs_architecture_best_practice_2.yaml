    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users adds
      an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor of authentication beyond
      just a password.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts
      as it requires an additional verification step. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      can easily lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section for any users without MFA enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam list-mfa-devices' for each user to verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select each user account and click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Click 'Manage' under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) and follow the steps
      to enable MFA.
    - Ensure all users are informed and guided on how to set up their MFA devices.
