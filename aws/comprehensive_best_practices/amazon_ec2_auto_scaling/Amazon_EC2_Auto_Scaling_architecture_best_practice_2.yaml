    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional
      layer of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms
      of authentication, enhancing the protection of AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized activities within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the 'Users' section to verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA devices and ensure all users are included.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select the 'Users' section.
    - Select each user and click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click on 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure all users have an MFA device assigned.
