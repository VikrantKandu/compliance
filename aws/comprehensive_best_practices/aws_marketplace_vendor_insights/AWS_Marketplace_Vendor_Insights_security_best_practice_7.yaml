    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all newly created S3 buckets are private
      by default. Public access should be explicitly granted only when necessary,
      minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      mitigate these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and ensure the "Access" column shows "Bucket and objects
      not public" for each bucket.
    - For programmatic verification, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> and verify that the ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets allow public access unless explicitly restricted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the "Block public access" settings and ensure all options are checked to
      block public access.
    - Save the changes to enforce the policy.
