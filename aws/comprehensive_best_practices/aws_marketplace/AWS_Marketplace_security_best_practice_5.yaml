    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that all S3 buckets have the correct
      permissions set to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the
      risk of sensitive data being accessed by unauthorized parties.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
