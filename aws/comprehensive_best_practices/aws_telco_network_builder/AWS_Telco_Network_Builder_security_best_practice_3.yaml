    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks by allowing unrestricted access. Ensuring instances are associated with
      custom security groups allows for more granular control over network traffic.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. Check the security group associated
      with each instance. 5. Verify that no instance is using the default security
      group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound
      rules tailored to your application's needs. 2. Disassociate the default security
      group from the instance. 3. Associate the newly created security group with
      the instance.
