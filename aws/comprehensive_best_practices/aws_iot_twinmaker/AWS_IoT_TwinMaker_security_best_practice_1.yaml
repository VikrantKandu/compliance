    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check to ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      This helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data leaks and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
