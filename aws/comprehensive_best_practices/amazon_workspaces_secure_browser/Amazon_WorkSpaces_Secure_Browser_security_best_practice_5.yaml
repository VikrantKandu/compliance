    Title: Ensure CloudFront Distributions are Configured with HTTPS
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFront distributions are configured
      to use HTTPS for secure data transmission. HTTPS encrypts the data between the
      client and the server, protecting sensitive information from interception.
    Rationale: Using HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between the client and the
      CloudFront distribution is encrypted, protecting it from potential eavesdropping
      or man-in-the-middle attacks. Failure to use HTTPS can lead to data breaches
      and compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Review each CloudFront distribution.
    - Check the settings for the Viewer Protocol Policy.
    - Ensure that the Viewer Protocol Policy is set to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" or
      "HTTPS Only".
    Default Value: CloudFront distributions default to allowing both HTTP and HTTPS.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select the distribution that is not compliant.
    - Edit the distribution settings.
    - Set the Viewer Protocol Policy to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" or "HTTPS Only".
    - Save the changes and deploy the updated configuration.
