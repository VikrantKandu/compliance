    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default minimizes the risk
      of unintentional data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify the ACL settings
      for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
