    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      information from unauthorized exposure. Public access can lead to data theft,
      loss of intellectual property, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for any public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
