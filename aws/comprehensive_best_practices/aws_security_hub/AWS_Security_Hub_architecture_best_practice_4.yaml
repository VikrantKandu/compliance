    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase
      the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      leakage, and potential breaches. Ensuring buckets are private helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
