    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, posing significant security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to verify that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
