    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring not
      only a password and username but also something that only the user has on them,
      i.e., a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users is recommended to enhance the security
      of AWS accounts. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible to unauthorized
      access, which can lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and go to the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
