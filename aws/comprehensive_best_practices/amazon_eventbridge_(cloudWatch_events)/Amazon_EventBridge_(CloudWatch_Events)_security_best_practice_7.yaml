    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to restrict
      public access, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify buckets with public access.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are
      enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block Public Access."
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
