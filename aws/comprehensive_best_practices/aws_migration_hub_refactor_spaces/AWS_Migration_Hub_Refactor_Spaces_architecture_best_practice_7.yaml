    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default
      helps protect data from being exposed to the public internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify
      that they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL for any entries that grant public access and
      remove or modify them.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent public access.
    - Regularly monitor and audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with
      security best practices.
