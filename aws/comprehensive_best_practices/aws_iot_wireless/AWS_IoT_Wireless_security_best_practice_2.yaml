    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to control access
      to your S3 buckets to protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces
      the risk of data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that the 'Block all
      public access' setting is enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policy or ACL allows
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access'. 6. Review and modify bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
