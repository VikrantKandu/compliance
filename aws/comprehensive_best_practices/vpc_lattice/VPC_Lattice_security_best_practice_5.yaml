  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      resulting in potential data loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Check the 'Block Public
      Access' settings to ensure that they are enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Enable 'Block Public Access' settings
      for the bucket. 4. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any
      public access permissions. 5. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer
      publicly accessible.
