    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to
      data leaks and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure,
      unauthorized access, and potential data breaches. Restricting public access
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public access" enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL configuration for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and disable "Public access".
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to apply the necessary bucket policy and ACL changes to restrict
      public access.
