  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
  - Rationale: Public S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, potentially
      leading to data leaks and unauthorized data access. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect sensitive information and complies with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the permissions tab for each bucket.
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Verify that
      the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the permissions tab
      and edit the bucket policy to restrict public access. 5. Enable "Block all public
      access" for the bucket. 6. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is private.
