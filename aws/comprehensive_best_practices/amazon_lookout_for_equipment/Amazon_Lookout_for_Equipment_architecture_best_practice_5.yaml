  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks by allowing unrestricted access. This can lead to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane. 4. For each instance, check
      the associated security groups. 5. Verify that none of the security groups are
      the default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified during creation.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify the EC2 instances using the default security group. 2.
      Create a new security group with the necessary rules for your application. 3.
      Detach the default security group from the instances. 4. Attach the newly created
      security group to the instances.
