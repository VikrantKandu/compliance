    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an additional
      layer of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms
      of identification before they can access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. If an attacker gains access to a user's password, they would still
      need the second factor to successfully authenticate. This practice helps protect
      sensitive data and resources from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
      Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
      Step 2: Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      Step 3: In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'.
      Step 4: For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
      Step 5: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
        to list users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
      Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
      Step 2: Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      Step 3: In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'.
      Step 4: Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
      Step 5: Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
      Step 6: Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
      Step 7: Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to
        the user.
