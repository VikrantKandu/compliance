    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users in an AWS
      account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password
      but also a second form of verification to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      it could lead to potential data breaches or unauthorized actions within the
      account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA' is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select the user.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, choose 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA, using either a virtual or hardware MFA device.
