    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires a second form
      of authentication, enhancing the security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access to
      the root account credentials can compromise the entire AWS environment, leading
      to potential data breaches and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', select 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to configure a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the setup by entering the MFA code.
