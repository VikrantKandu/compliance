    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public read or write
      permissions, which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the risk
      of sensitive data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
        no public access policies are attached.
    - Step 4: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify that public access is not granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Remove any public access policies from the S3 bucket.
    - Step 2: Adjust the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users or
        roles.
    - Step 3: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
