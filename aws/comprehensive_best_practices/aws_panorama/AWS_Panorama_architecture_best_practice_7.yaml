  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access, potentially exposing sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are
      private by default helps maintain data security and compliance with privacy
      regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets.
    - Review and update IAM policies to ensure they do not grant unintended public
      access.
