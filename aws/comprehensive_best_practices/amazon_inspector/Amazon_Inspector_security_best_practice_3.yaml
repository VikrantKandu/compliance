    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information and
      comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list to identify any buckets with public access settings.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings
      to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access at the account
      level.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
