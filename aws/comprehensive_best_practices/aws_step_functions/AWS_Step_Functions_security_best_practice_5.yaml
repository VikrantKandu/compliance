    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and pose security
      risks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket policies and verify
      that they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use IAM policies to control access to S3 resources and ensure only authorized
      users have access.
