    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This security check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      is enabled for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides
      an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form
      of authentication, which helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access, data breaches, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under "Security credentials", choose "Manage MFA".
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
