    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials by requiring a second form
      of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access in case of compromised
      passwords. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to open the details page.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage' and follow the steps to
      assign an MFA device.
