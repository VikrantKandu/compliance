    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, which
      helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA helps mitigate
      this risk by requiring an additional verification step.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA' column to verify
      that MFA is enabled for each user. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically check MFA
      status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Click on the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage'. 7. Follow the instructions to assign
      and activate an MFA device for the user.
