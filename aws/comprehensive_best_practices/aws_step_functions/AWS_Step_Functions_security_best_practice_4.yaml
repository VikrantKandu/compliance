    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are private by default protects data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
