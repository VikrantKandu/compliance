    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      required. This helps to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and
      potential breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access and data leakage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that the 'Block
      public access' settings are enabled. 5. Check the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) to verify no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Enable 'Block public access' settings for the bucket. 2. Review
      and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly monitor and audit the bucket settings to ensure compliance.
