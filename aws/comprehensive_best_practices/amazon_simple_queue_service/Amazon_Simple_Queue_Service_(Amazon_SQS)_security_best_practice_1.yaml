    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for data security.
      Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing
      a significant risk of data exposure and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs and verify
      that they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to update permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
