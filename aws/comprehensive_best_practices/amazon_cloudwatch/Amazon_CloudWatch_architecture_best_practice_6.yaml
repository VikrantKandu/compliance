    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication, typically a physical token or a mobile app,
      in addition to their password. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials and unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, the
      account can be easily accessed, leading to potential data breaches or misuse
      of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
      verify that each user has an associated MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts to enable a virtual or hardware
      MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users.
