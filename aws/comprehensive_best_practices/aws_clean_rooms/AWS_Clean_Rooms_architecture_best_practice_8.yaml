    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you reduce the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Unrestricted public access can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy does not grant public access. 5. Check the Block Public Access settings
      for each bucket and ensure that all options are enabled. 6. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the ACL
      does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Click on the Permissions tab. 4. Edit the bucket policy
      to remove any statements that allow public access. 5. Enable Block Public Access
      settings for the bucket. 6. Review and adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does
      not allow public access.
