    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of user name and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      AWS accounts by requiring additional verification during sign-in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the account. MFA requires a second factor,
      such as a code from a mobile device, making it much harder for unauthorized
      users to gain access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for the MFA device icon.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with configured MFA devices.
    Default Value: IAM users can be created without MFA enabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user and choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable an MFA device for the user.
