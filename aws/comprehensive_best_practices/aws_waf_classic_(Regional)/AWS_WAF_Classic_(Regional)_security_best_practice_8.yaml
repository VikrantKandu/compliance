    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data leaks and security breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to only necessary users helps mitigate these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket ACL for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access unless configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the changes.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
