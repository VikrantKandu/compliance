    Title: Ensure CloudFormation stacks are monitored for drift detection
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFormation stacks are regularly
      monitored for drift detection to identify any changes in stack resources that
      are not reflected in the stack template. Drift detection helps maintain the
      integrity and consistency of the infrastructure as defined by the CloudFormation
      templates.
    Rationale: Monitoring for drift in CloudFormation stacks is crucial to ensure
      that the infrastructure remains consistent with the declared configuration.
      Unmonitored drift can lead to security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and
      operational issues. Regular drift detection helps in maintaining control over
      the infrastructure and prevents unauthorized changes.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select a CloudFormation stack.
    - Check for drift detection status and ensure that it is regularly performed.
    - Verify that any detected drift is addressed and resolved in a timely manner.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stacks do not automatically monitor
      for drift. Manual drift detection must be initiated.
    Remediation:
    - Initiate drift detection for the CloudFormation stack through the AWS Management
      Console, CLI, or SDK.
    - Review the drift results and update the stack resources or template as necessary
      to resolve any drift.
    - Implement a regular schedule for drift detection to maintain infrastructure
      consistency.
