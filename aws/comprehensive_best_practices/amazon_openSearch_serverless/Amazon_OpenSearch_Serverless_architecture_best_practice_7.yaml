    Title: Ensure IAM Policies Are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not attached directly to
      individual users but rather to groups or roles. This helps in managing permissions
      more effectively and reduces the potential for privilege escalation.
    Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures that are hard to manage and audit. By attaching policies to groups
      or roles, permissions are centralized, making it easier to maintain and reducing
      the risk of excessive or unintended permissions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the Policies section to identify any policies attached directly to users.
    - Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead of individual users.
    Default Value: By default, AWS allows policies to be attached to users, groups,
      or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies attached directly to users.
    - Create or identify appropriate groups or roles.
    - Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles.
    - Add users to the groups or assign roles as needed.
