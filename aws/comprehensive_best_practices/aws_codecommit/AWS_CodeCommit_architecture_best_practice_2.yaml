    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default reduces this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Verify that the bucket is not publicly accessible by checking the bucket policy
      and access control lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not private by default; they require configuration
      to ensure privacy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Update the bucket policy to deny public access.
    - Modify the ACLs to ensure only authorized users have access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
