    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default.
      Using the default security group can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to EC2 instances. This can lead to unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches. It is recommended to use custom security groups with
      specific rules tailored to the needs of the application.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
