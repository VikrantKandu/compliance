    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions settings. 4. Check the 'Block
      Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies
      and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block Public Access' enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Enable 'Block Public Access' settings
      for the bucket. 4. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they
      do not grant public access. 5. Save the changes to apply the new settings.
