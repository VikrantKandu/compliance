    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because it is the most
      privileged account in an AWS environment. If compromised, it could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data loss or manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section for the root account MFA status.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, select Activate MFA on your root account.
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA setup to ensure it is active.
