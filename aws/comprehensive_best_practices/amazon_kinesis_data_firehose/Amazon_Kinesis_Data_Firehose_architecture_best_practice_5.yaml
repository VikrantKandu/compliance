    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide more than one form of verification to access AWS
      resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are stolen,
      an attacker can gain unauthorized access to AWS resources, potentially leading
      to data breaches and service disruptions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Click on the 'Security credentials' tab. 6.
      In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, click on 'Assign MFA device'.
      7. Follow the prompts to configure and enable an MFA device for the user.
