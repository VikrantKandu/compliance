    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are not public helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the "Public access settings" feature to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, edit the bucket policy to remove
      any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the "Block all public access" feature to prevent public access settings.
