    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps protect
      sensitive data.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no
      public access permissions granted. 4. Verify that the bucket policy and access
      control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Review and modify the bucket
      policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions. 5. Enable block public
      access settings for the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
