    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to sensitive data
      being exposed to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private enhances security
      and compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and ensure that "Block all public access" is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and ensure that no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, log into the AWS Management
      Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and remove any public access policies or ACLs that grant public permissions.
