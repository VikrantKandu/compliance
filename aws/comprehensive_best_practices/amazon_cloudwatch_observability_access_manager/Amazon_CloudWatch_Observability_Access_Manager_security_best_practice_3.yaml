    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized access. Unrestricted public access can lead to sensitive data
      being exposed to the internet, resulting in security incidents and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is allowed.
