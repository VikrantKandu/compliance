    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet, potentially leading to data
      leaks. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets may allow public access if not properly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Regularly audit bucket settings to ensure compliance with access policies.
