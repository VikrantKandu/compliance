    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to
      data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers to
      access sensitive information or store malicious content.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
