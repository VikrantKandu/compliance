    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure data
      confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket's Public Access Settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket's Public Access Settings to block all public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure ongoing compliance.
