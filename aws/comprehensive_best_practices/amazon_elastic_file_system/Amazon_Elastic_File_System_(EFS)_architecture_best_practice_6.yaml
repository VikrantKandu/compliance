    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an additional layer of protection on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, an attacker with a stolen password
      could gain full access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the list of users and verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to list users and their MFA status by running the command: aws
        iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>
        for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select the user for whom you want to enable
      MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
