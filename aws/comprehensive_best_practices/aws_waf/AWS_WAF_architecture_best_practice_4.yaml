    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional layer
      of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms of identification
      before gaining access to sensitive resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA, compromised
      credentials could lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to Assigned MFA device and follow the instructions to enable
      MFA.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to enable MFA by executing aws iam enable-mfa-device
      with the appropriate parameters.
