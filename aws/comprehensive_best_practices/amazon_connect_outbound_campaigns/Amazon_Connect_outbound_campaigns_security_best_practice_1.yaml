    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data leaks. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the
      risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and ACLs to confirm that they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to the bucket as necessary.
