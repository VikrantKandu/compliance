    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive data is
      exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect against data breaches and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket ACL for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and adjust any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
