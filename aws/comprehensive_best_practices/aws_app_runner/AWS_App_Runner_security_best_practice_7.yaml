    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      data loss, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      grant public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm that public access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
