  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you minimize the risk of
      data leaks and unauthorized access. Public buckets can expose sensitive data
      to the internet, leading to compliance and security issues.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions of each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use the Amazon S3 Block
      Public Access feature to block public access at the account and bucket level.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      any public access permissions. 4. Enable the Block Public Access feature for
      the bucket. 5. Verify that no public access is granted through IAM policies.
