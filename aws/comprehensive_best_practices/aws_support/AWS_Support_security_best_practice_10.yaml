    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should have policies and permissions
      configured to restrict public access unless explicitly required for business
      purposes.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data leaks and ensures that only authorized users can access the data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket.
    - Confirm that 'Block all public access' is enabled unless there is a justified
      business need.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 service in
      the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket and click on 'Permissions'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to restrict public access.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      they do not allow public access unless necessary.
