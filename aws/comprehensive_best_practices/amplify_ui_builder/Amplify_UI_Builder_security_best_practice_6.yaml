    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are private and not publicly
      accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can potentially expose sensitive data
      to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the risk of
      data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket ACL is not set to allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy with aws s3api put-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> --policy <policy-json> to ensure no public access is
      allowed.
