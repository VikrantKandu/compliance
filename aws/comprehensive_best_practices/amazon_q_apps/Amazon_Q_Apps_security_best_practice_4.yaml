    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private by default
      to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By default, S3 buckets should be private to
      ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the Access column to ensure that no buckets are
      publicly accessible.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) to confirm
      that they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is denied
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any S3 buckets that are publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future configurations
      that might allow public access.
