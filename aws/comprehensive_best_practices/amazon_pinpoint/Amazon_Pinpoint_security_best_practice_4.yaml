    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication. This helps
      protect user credentials from being compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access
      to a user's credentials can access AWS resources without any additional verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user for whom MFA is not enabled.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' and follow the steps
      to enable MFA.
