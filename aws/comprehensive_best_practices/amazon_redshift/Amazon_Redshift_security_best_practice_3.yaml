    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches as they allow
      anyone on the internet to access the data. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible mitigates the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure the Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to S3 and select the affected bucket.
    - Click on the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
