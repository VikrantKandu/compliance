    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This security check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      is enabled for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to enter a unique authentication code from
      a device they possess, in addition to their standard login credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are
      compromised, an attacker could gain full access to your account. MFA adds an
      extra layer of protection, as the attacker would also need access to the user's
      MFA device.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Check each user to verify
      if MFA is enabled. This can be done by selecting a user and viewing their security
      status. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
      to list all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the IAM
      user for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
      6. Under "Assigned MFA device", choose "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
