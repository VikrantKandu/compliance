    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional layer
      of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms of authentication,
      making unauthorized access more difficult.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring additional verification
      beyond just a password, reducing the risk of compromised credentials. Without
      MFA, accounts are more susceptible to unauthorized access, potentially leading
      to data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Check the list of IAM users and verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage" and follow the prompts
      to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
