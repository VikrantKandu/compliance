    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to present two or more separate forms of identification before accessing
      AWS resources. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA Device" column to ensure an MFA device is assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - Click on the individual user name to view their details.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
