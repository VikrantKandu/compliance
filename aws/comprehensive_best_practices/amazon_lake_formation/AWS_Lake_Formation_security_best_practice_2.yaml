    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data
      exposure, leading to potential data breaches and loss of sensitive information.
      Restricting public access helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check if the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with access policies.
