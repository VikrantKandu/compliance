    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to your data. Publicly accessible buckets can
      lead to data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
      Restricting public access helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that all "Block Public Access" options are enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
