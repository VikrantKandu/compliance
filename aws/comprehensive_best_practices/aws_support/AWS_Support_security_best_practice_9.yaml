    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      helps in securing data stored in S3.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access to ensure
      they are restricted.
