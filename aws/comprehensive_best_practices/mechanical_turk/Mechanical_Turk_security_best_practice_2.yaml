    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and meets compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Server-side encryption in Amazon S3 provides an additional layer of
      security by encrypting data stored in S3 buckets. Without encryption, data is
      vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and non-compliance
      with regulatory standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the properties of the bucket for server-side encryption settings.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled with an appropriate encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the properties of the bucket.
    - Enable server-side encryption by selecting an encryption method such as AES-256
      or AWS-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
