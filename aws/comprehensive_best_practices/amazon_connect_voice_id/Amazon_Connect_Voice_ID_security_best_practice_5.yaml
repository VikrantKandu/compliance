    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data is not exposed to unauthorized users. This is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public reduces the
      risk of data breaches and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a policy that allows public access.
    - Confirm that the bucket's Access Control List (ACL) does not permit public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings.
