    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with default
      security groups, which typically allow unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic.
      This practice helps in maintaining a more secure environment by enforcing stricter
      network access controls.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can pose security risks as they often
      allow unrestricted access, making instances vulnerable to unauthorized access
      and attacks. By ensuring that instances are associated with custom security
      groups, you can define specific inbound and outbound rules that align with your
      security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the Security Groups column for each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with a default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with default security
      groups that allow all inbound and outbound traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using default security groups.
    - Create or modify security groups to define specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the instances with the newly created or modified security groups and
      disassociate them from the default security group.
