    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible Only When Necessary
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to be publicly accessible only when
      absolutely necessary to minimize the risk of unauthorized data access. Public
      access should be restricted and monitored.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      data is exposed. Restricting public access reduces the attack surface and protects
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket to ensure public access is disabled unless
      explicitly required.
    - Check the bucket policy and public access settings.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and verify the settings programmatically.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not publicly accessible by default.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the buckets that are publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policies and access control lists to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
