    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to only authorized users reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access settings
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent accidental public exposure.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with access
      policies.
