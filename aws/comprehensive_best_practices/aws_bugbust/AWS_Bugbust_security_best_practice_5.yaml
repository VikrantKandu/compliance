    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized
      data manipulation, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block all public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to grant necessary
      access permissions securely.
