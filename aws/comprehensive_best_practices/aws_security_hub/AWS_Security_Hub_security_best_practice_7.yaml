    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Identify buckets with public access policies or ACLs and review their necessity.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and remove any public access policies or ACLs that are not necessary.
