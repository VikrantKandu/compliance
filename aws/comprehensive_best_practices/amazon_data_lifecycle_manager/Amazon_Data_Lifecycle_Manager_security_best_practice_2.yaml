    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication. This helps
      protect your account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to your AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to potential
      data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA" and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
