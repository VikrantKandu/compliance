    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      private reduces these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to verify no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to script these changes if needed for multiple buckets.
