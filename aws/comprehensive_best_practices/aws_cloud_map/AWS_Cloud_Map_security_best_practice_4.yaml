    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can pose a security risk if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      resources. It is important to create specific security groups with rules tailored
      to the needs of the application to minimize the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group upon creation if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance using the default security group, select the instance.
    - Click on 'Actions', then 'Networking', and select 'Change Security Groups'.
    - Associate the instance with a non-default security group that has the appropriate
      rules.
    - Remove the default security group from the instance.
