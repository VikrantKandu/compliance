    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure data
      confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the risk of data exposure and
      aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block Public Access' settings
      are enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to specific users and roles as needed.
