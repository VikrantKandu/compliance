    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: By restricting public access to S3 buckets, organizations can prevent
      unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk
      of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure
      no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and select "Block all public access."
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
