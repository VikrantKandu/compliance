    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be explicitly
      granted only when necessary.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      the risk of exposing data to the public.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for all buckets.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not allowed
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
