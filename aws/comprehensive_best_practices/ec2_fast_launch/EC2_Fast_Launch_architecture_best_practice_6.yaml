    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled to
      protect the data at rest. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and
      ensure data confidentiality.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets protects sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data
      stored in S3 is vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access, especially
      if access controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if 'Default encryption' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket_name> to verify encryption status.
    Default Value: S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable 'Default encryption'.
    - Select the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
