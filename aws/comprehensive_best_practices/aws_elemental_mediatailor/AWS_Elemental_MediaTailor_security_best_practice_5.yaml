    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. If buckets are publicly accessible, data can be exposed
      to anyone on the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets allow public access unless explicitly restricted.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to secure.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Under 'Block Public Access', ensure all options are checked to block public
      access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
