  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data leaks, compliance violations, and potential financial and reputational
      damage.
  - Audit: Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to list all S3 buckets
      in your account. Check the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to
      ensure that they do not allow public access. Specifically, verify that no bucket
      policies or ACLs grant 'Everyone' or 'Anonymous' permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy and ACLs to restrict access. Remove any statements that grant public
      access and ensure that only authorized users and roles have permissions. Use
      the S3 Block Public Access feature to further restrict public access to buckets
      and objects.
