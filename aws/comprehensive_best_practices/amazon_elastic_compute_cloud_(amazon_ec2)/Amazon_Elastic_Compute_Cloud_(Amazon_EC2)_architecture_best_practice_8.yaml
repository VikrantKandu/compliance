    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that EC2 instances are not associated with default security
      groups to enhance security by minimizing open access.
    Rationale: Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can expose instances to unauthorized access and potential attacks. Ensuring
      instances use custom security groups with specific rules reduces the attack
      surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the associated security groups for each instance.
    - Ensure that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with the default security
      group, which allows all traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances previously using the default
      group.
    - Remove the default security group association from those instances.
