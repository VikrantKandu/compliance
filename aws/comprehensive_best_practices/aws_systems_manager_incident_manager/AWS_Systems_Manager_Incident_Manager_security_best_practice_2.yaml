    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This best practice check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA
      adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second
      form of authentication, typically a temporary code from a mobile device or hardware
      token, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the AWS account. MFA significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the left pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select each user and check the 'Security
      credentials' tab for MFA devices. 5. Verify that each user has an MFA device
      assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the left pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 5. Go to the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Click on 'Manage'
      under 'Assigned MFA device'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an
      MFA device for the user.
