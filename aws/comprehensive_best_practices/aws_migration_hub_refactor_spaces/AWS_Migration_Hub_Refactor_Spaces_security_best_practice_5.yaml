    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have No Console Password
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: It is a best practice to ensure that IAM users do not have a console
      password unless absolutely necessary. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access through the AWS Management Console.
    Rationale: By not assigning console passwords to IAM users, you minimize the attack
      surface for unauthorized access attempts. This is especially important for users
      who only need programmatic access through API keys, as it helps enforce the
      principle of least privilege.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Console Access column to verify if a console password
      is set.
    - Ensure users do not have a console password unless absolutely necessary.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users can be created without console passwords.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Select the user with a console password that should be removed.
    - Click on the Security Credentials tab.
    - Under Console Access, click Manage to remove the console password.
    - Ensure the user has appropriate programmatic access if needed.
