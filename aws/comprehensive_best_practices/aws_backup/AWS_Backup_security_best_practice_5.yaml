    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and
      potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are
      private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled for every bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
