    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets have versioning enabled.
      Versioning allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket,
      which can help protect against accidental deletions and overwrites.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets is crucial for data protection and
      recovery. Without versioning, accidental deletions or overwrites could result
      in data loss. Versioning helps to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version
      of every object stored in an S3 bucket.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to check.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Check if 'Versioning' is enabled under the 'Bucket Versioning' section.
    Default Value: S3 buckets have versioning disabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have versioning enabled.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Bucket Versioning', click 'Edit'.
    - Enable versioning and save changes.
