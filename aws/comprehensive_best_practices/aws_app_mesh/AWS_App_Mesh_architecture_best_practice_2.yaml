    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users with console access have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials from being
      compromised. Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen, the account can be
      accessed by unauthorized parties, leading to potential data breaches and security
      incidents.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device to the user.
