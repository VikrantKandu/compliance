    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private and do not
      allow public access. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates the risk of sensitive
      information being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the ACLs for each
      bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Consider enabling the "Block Public Access" feature for additional security.
