    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication. This check
      ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to AWS resources. MFA helps prevent unauthorized access even
      if a password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
        list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each user to verify MFA devices.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the left navigation pane.
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
