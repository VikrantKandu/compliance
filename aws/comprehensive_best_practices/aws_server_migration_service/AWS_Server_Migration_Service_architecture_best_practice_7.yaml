    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor authentication
      enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password
      and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a physical
      device or a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials. If an IAM
      user's password is stolen, MFA provides an additional barrier against unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab for the presence of MFA.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
