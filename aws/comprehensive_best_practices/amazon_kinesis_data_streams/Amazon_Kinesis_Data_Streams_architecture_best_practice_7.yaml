    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the login process by requiring users to provide an additional piece of information
      beyond their password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect sensitive
      resources and data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials, as it requires
      an additional authentication factor. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker with
      stolen credentials could gain full access to AWS resources, leading to potential
      data breaches or misuse of services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check the "MFA" column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - For each user, click on the user name to open the user details page.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
