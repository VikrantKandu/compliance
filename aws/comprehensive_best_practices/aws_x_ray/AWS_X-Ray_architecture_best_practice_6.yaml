    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of user accounts. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such
      as a code sent to a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised passwords can lead to unauthorized
      access, potentially resulting in data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
