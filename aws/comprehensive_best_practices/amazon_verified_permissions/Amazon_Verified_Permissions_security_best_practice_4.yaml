    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs that have been
      approved by the organization's security and compliance team to ensure they meet
      security and configuration standards.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and non-compliant
      configurations, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running instances and note their AMI IDs.
    - Compare these AMI IDs against a list of approved AMIs maintained by the organization.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI by default.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running on unapproved AMIs.
    - Plan to replace these instances with new ones launched from approved AMIs.
    - Update the organization's policies and procedures to ensure only approved AMIs
      are used for future instance launches.
