    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users in your AWS account. MFA
      adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a unique authentication
      code from a device in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources against
      unauthorized access. If an IAM user's credentials are compromised, MFA can prevent
      the attacker from accessing your account without the second factor of authentication.
      Not following this best practice can lead to potential security breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA enabled' is set to 'Yes' under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
        list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the username for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device to
      the user.
    - Ensure all users have MFA enabled to comply with this best practice.
