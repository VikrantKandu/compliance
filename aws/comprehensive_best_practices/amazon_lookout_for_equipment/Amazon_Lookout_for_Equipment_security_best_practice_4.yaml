    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      and reduces the risk of data leaks. Public access can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure and potential misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to grant access only to specific users or roles.
