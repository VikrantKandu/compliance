    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the Block Public
      Access settings and ensure all options are enabled. 5. Verify the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have Block Public Access settings enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket. 2. Review
      and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
