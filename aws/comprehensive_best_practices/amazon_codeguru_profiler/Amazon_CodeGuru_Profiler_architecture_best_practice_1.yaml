    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict public
      access to prevent sensitive data leakage.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential loss of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Confirm that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
