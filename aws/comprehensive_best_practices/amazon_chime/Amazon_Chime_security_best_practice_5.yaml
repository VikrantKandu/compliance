    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDKs to list bucket permissions and check for
      public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block Public Access settings.
    - Ensure all public access settings are enabled to block public access.
    - If public access is required, use bucket policies or IAM roles to restrict access
      to specific users or services.
