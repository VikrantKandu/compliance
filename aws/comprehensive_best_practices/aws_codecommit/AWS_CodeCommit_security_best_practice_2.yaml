    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for
      all IAM users to enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of your AWS account by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab, and under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA),
      choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
