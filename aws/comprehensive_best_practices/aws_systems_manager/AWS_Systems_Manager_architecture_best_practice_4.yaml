    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to be private to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Public buckets can expose data to the internet,
      increasing the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private minimizes the risk of unauthorized data
      access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket is marked as Public.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the bucket's Permissions tab
      in the AWS Management Console.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL and bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions and enable bucket policies that only allow
      access to specific IAM roles or users.
