    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile phone
      app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      can gain access to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to see if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
    - Ensure all IAM users have MFA enabled.
