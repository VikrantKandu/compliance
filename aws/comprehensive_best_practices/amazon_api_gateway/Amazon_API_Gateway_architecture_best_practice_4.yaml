    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access
      to AWS resources. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of compromised accounts
      and enhances the security posture of the AWS environment. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Choose the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the
      instructions to enable a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device for the user.
