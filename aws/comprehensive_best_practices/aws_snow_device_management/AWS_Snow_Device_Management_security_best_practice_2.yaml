    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled. Encryption helps protect sensitive data at rest by converting it into
      a form that is unreadable to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption for S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data can be exposed in the
      event of a security breach or if access controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify if "Default encryption" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket you want to encrypt.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption".
    - Choose the appropriate encryption method (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C) based on
      your requirements.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
