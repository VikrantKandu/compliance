  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Latest AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using the latest AMIs ensures that instances
      have the most recent security patches and updates.
  - Rationale: Running instances with outdated AMIs can expose the system to vulnerabilities
      that have been fixed in newer versions. It's crucial to use the latest AMIs
      to protect against known security issues and to benefit from performance improvements.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      AMI ID and compare it with the latest available AMI for that instance type.
      5. Verify that the AMI in use is the latest version.
  - Default Value: By default, instances may not be configured to use the latest AMIs
      unless explicitly specified during launch.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances using outdated AMIs. 2. Plan for an update
      or replacement of these instances with the latest AMIs. 3. Create a new instance
      using the latest AMI and migrate workloads if necessary. 4. Terminate the old
      instance once the new instance is verified to be working correctly.
