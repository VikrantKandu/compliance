    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict public
      access to prevent data breaches and maintain data privacy.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, legal issues, and damage to the organization's
      reputation. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and review the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings and ensure all options are enabled. 5. Verify that there are
      no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and click "Edit" under
      "Block public access." 4. Enable all options to block public access and save
      changes. 5. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access
      permissions.
