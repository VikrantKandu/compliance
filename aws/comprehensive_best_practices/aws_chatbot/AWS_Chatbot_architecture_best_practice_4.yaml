    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS
      IAM users. A strong password policy helps protect against unauthorized access
      by enforcing complexity requirements and expiration periods.
    Rationale: Without a strong password policy, user accounts may be vulnerable to
      brute force attacks or unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches
      and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets the organization's requirements
      for complexity, length, and expiration.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'.
    - Enable the password policy and configure it to meet the required complexity,
      length, and expiration settings.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
