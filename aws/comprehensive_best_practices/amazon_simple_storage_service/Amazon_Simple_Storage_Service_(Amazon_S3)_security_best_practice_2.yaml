    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      in order to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      data leaks and unauthorized access. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone
      on the internet, which can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review any bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do
      not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and modify any bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
