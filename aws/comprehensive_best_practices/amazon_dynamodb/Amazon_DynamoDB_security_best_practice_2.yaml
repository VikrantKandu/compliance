  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for data security.
      Without proper access controls, sensitive data stored in S3 can be accessed
      by anyone, leading to data loss or exposure. Implementing this check helps prevent
      unauthorized access and protects data integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block Public
      Access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked. 5. Review the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm that they do not allow public
      access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that needs remediation. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to
      remove any statements that allow public access. 5. Save the changes to enforce
      the new settings.
