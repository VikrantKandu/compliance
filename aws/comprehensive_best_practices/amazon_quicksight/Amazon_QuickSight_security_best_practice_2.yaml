    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such
      as a temporary code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen, an attacker can access the account
      without any additional verification. This can lead to unauthorized access to
      sensitive resources and data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA device' is enabled under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        --user-name <username> to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the username for which you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
