  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. The best practice is to keep
      S3 buckets private and only grant necessary permissions to specific users or
      roles.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. By ensuring that buckets are private, organizations
      can better control access to sensitive data and comply with data protection
      regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and block public access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to review the ACLs and ensure
      no public grants are present.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket settings to
      block all public access.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
