  - Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides data protection
      by encrypting the data before it is stored and decrypting it when accessed.
  - Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. If encryption is
      not enabled, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to interception and unauthorized
      access.
  - Audit: To verify compliance, list all S3 buckets and check the bucket properties
      to ensure that server-side encryption is enabled. This can be done using the
      AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Specifically, check if the "Default
      Encryption" setting is configured for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled
      unless explicitly configured.
  - Remediation: To remediate non-compliant buckets, enable server-side encryption
      by setting a default encryption configuration. This can be done through the
      AWS Management Console by navigating to the S3 bucket properties, selecting
      "Default Encryption," and choosing an encryption option such as Amazon S3-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).
