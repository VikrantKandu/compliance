    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and do not allow public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets set to public can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure they are not publicly accessible.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove
      public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access settings.
