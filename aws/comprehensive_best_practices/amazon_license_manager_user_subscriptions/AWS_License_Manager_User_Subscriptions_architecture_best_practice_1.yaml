    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure. AWS S3 buckets should have appropriate permissions
      to ensure that sensitive data is not publicly accessible.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data exposure and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure public access is restricted.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new permissions.
