    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an extra
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      such as a one-time passcode, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If an IAM user's password is compromised, MFA provides
      an additional barrier that an attacker must overcome. Without MFA, the risk
      of unauthorized access increases, potentially leading to data breaches and other
      security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the Security credentials
      tab.
    - Verify that all users have an assigned MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
