    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab. 4. Verify that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled. 5. If any bucket has public access, ensure there is a valid
      business justification.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default with public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the 'Permissions' tab. 5.
      Enable 'Block all public access'. 6. Save changes to apply the new settings.
