    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Consider using the "Block Public Access" feature for enhanced security.
    - Re-evaluate the need for any public access and apply the principle of least
      privilege.
