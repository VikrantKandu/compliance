    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to the data stored within them. S3 buckets should
      not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information and
      complies with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the 'Public Access
      Settings' for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may change
      over time.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to ensure the bucket is private.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
