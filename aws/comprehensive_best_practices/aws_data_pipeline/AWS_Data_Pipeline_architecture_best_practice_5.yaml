    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3
      buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, leading to potential data leaks and unauthorized access. Ensuring
      that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block all public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with the best
      practice.
