    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for user sign-in by requiring more than just a password to authenticate. Enabling
      MFA for all IAM users helps protect against compromised credentials and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker
      can gain full access to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by
      requiring an additional verification factor.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate an MFA device for the user.
