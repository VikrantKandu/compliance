  - Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation stacks are encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks utilize encryption
      to protect sensitive data. Encryption helps safeguard the data within the stack
      resources from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  - Rationale: Encrypting CloudFormation stacks protects sensitive information by
      ensuring that data at rest is secured. Without encryption, sensitive data could
      be exposed to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select a stack and review its resources. 4. Verify that resources
      such as S3 buckets, RDS instances, and EBS volumes associated with the stack
      have encryption enabled. 5. Check the stack's template to ensure encryption
      parameters are defined and used.
  - Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stacks do not enforce encryption on
      resources unless specified in the template.
  - Remediation: 1. Update the CloudFormation template to include encryption parameters
      for all applicable resources. 2. Redeploy the stack with the updated template
      to apply encryption. 3. For existing resources, manually enable encryption where
      applicable and ensure future resources are created with encryption by default.
