    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. It is crucial to restrict access to
      only those who need it to maintain data security and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to confirm
      access control settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
