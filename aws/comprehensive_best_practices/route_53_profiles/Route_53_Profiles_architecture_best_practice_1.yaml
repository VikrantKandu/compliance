    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance,
      and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. By enabling CloudTrail
      in all regions, you ensure that all activities in your account are logged and
      can be reviewed for security and compliance.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions helps ensure that all API calls
      made in your AWS account are captured and logged. This is crucial for auditing
      purposes, detecting unauthorized access, and maintaining a secure environment.
      Without this, you risk missing important security events that could lead to
      data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that there is at least one trail created and it is logging events in
      all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is configured to capture all management events and data
      events as required.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or update an existing trail to enable it in all regions.
    - Ensure the trail is configured to capture all necessary management and data
      events.
    - Save the changes to apply the new configuration.
