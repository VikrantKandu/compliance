    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring that buckets are private and access is controlled helps mitigate
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    - Check bucket policies and ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless specified
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      public access.
