    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS S3 buckets are configured to be private
      and restrict public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets may be configured to allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and inspect the bucket permissions.
    - Confirm that all buckets have the "Block all public access" setting enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, but configurations might change
      over time.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that requires remediation.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is private.
