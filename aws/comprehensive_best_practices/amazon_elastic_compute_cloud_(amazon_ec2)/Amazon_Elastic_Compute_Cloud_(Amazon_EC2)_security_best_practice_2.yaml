    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to significant security risks,
      including data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default reduces these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      in the permissions tab.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only specific users or roles.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
