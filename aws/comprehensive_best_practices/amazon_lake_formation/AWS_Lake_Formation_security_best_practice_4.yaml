    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which is a critical security best practice to prevent unauthorized access to
      sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature in the S3 console to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with
      best practices.
