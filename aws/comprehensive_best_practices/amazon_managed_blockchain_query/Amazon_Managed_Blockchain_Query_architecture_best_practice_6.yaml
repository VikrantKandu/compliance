    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound traffic
      from instances within the group and unrestricted outbound traffic, which can
      lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risk, as it permits unrestricted communication between instances. This can lead
      to potential breaches if one instance is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with the necessary inbound and outbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the EC2 instances.
    - Attach the newly created security group to the instances.
    - Ensure that the new security group rules are as restrictive as possible while
      allowing necessary traffic.
