    Title: Ensure IAM Policies Are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles rather than directly
      to individual users. This practice helps in managing permissions at a group
      level, reducing the complexity and potential for error.
    Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to users can lead to a complex permissions
      structure that is difficult to manage and audit. By attaching policies to groups
      or roles, permissions can be managed more efficiently, and the principle of
      least privilege can be more easily enforced. This reduces the risk of excessive
      permissions and potential security vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM users and identify any users with policies attached directly.
    - Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead of individual users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies attached directly to users.
    - Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles.
    - Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles.
    - Add users to the groups or assign the roles as needed to ensure the required
      permissions are granted.
