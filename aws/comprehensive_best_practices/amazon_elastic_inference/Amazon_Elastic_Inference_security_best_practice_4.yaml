  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to these
      buckets is crucial for maintaining data security and privacy.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify
      that they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Remove any policies or ACLs that allow public access to the bucket.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
