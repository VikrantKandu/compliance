    Title: Ensure CloudWatch Logs are encrypted at rest
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that CloudWatch Logs are encrypted at rest using
      AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to protect sensitive data.
    Rationale: Encrypting CloudWatch Logs at rest helps protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Without encryption, logs could be accessed by unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
    - Select Logs from the left-hand menu.
    - For each log group, verify that encryption is enabled by checking the KMS key
      settings.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws logs describe-log-groups and check
      the kmsKeyId field for each log group.
    Default Value: By default, CloudWatch Logs are not encrypted at rest.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
    - Select Logs from the left-hand menu.
    - For each log group, click on the log group name.
    - Choose the 'Actions' dropdown and select 'Edit' for the log group.
    - Under the 'KMS Key' section, select the appropriate KMS key to enable encryption.
    - Save the changes.
