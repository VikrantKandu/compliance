    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      not only a password but also a secondary form of authentication, such as a code
      from a mobile device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by requiring an additional
      authentication factor, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. If not enabled,
      accounts are more vulnerable to attacks that can compromise credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: IAM users do not have MFA enabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
