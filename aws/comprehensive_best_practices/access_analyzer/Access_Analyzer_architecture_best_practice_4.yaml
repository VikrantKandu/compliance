    Title: Ensure IAM Policies Are Attached to Groups or Roles, Not Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles rather than directly
      to individual users. This practice simplifies management and enhances security
      by ensuring that permissions are managed collectively rather than individually.
    Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures that are difficult to manage and audit. It also increases the risk
      of privilege creep, where users accumulate permissions over time. By attaching
      policies to groups or roles, permissions can be managed more efficiently and
      securely.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Step 4: Select each user to check if any policies are directly attached.
    - Step 5: Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead of individual
        users.
    Default Value: Policies are not attached to individual users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify any users with directly attached policies.
    - Step 2: Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles.
    - Step 3: Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles.
    - Step 4: Add users to the groups or assign roles to them as needed.
    - Step 5: Remove the directly attached policies from individual users.
