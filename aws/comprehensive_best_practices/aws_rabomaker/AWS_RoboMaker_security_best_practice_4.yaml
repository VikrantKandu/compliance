    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure, posing significant security and compliance risks. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure there is no public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to verify that public access settings
      are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block all public access at the account
      and bucket levels.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best practices.
