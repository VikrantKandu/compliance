    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Public
      access can expose sensitive data and increase the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Edit the bucket permissions to remove any policies that allow public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update IAM policies to ensure they do not grant public access.
