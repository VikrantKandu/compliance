    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the security of user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's
      password can potentially gain full access to AWS resources. MFA helps protect
      against compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check if the 'MFA' column indicates that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws iam list-users and for each user, check with
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices are
        configured.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage'.
    - Select 'Activate MFA' and follow the instructions to assign an MFA device.
