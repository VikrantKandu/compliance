    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to user accounts,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      could lead to data breaches or unauthorized actions within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by viewing the Security Credentials tab.
    - Verify that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, choose the user name, go to the Security Credentials
      tab, and select Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
