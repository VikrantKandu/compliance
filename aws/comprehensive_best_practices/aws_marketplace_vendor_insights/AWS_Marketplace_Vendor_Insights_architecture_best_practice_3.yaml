    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive data, reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining
      data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled and that
      bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs for public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket ACL and policy to restrict public access.
