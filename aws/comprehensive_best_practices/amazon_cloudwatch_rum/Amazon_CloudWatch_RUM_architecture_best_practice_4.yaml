    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be enabled for all AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by requiring a second
      form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to user accounts,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Without
      MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing and password guessing.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices for
        each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable virtual MFA or hardware MFA device for the user.
