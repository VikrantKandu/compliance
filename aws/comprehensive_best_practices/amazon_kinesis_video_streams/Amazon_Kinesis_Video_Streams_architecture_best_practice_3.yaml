    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Ensure there are no public access policies attached to the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private with "Block all public access"
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Access the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if it is not already enabled.
    - Remove any public access policies from the bucket.
