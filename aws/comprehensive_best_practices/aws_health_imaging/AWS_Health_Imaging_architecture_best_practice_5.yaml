  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Versioning Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have versioning enabled to
      protect against accidental or malicious data deletion or modification.
  - Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps protect data by keeping multiple
      versions of an object in the same bucket. It allows for recovery from unintended
      user actions and application failures, reducing the risk of data loss.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Versioning" is set to "Enabled".
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have versioning disabled.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have versioning enabled.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Click on "Versioning" and select "Enable versioning".
    - Save the changes to apply versioning to the bucket.
