    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible protects sensitive data and maintains compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket's ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
