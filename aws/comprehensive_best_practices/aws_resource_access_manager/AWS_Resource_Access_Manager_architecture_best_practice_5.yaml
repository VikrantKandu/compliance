    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to compliance violations and reputational
      damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust IAM policies to ensure they do not grant unintended public
      access.
