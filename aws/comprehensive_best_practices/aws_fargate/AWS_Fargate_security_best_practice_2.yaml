    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an extra layer
      of security. MFA requires users to provide additional authentication factors
      beyond just a password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly enhances the security of user accounts by
      requiring a second form of verification. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, especially if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, select 'Security Credentials'.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
