    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Check bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Save changes and verify the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
