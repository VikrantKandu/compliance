    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data loss or exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private
      by default helps protect against unintended data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to review ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Remove any statements in the bucket policy that grant public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature in the S3 console to prevent public settings.
