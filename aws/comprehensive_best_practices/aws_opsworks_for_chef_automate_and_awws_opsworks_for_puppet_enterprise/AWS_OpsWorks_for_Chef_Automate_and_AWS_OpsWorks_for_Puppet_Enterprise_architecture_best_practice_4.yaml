    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access and data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers,
      leading to data exposure and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that there are no public
      access permissions set.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check the bucket's ACL and policy for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings in the S3 console to prevent public access
      at the bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
