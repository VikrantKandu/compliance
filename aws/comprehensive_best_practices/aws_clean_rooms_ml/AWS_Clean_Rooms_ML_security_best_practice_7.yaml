    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring an additional verification code along with the
      password. This helps protect accounts from unauthorized access even if the password
      is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, attackers can easily
      gain access to AWS resources if they acquire valid credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select each user and check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
