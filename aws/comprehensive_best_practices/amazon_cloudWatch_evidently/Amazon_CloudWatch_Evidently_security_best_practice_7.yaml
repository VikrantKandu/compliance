    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance violations,
      and financial losses.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the "Block Public
      Access" settings are enabled. 5. Verify that there are no public access policies
      or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Enable "Block Public Access" for the bucket. 2. Remove any bucket
      policies or ACLs that allow public access. 3. Regularly review bucket permissions
      to ensure compliance.
