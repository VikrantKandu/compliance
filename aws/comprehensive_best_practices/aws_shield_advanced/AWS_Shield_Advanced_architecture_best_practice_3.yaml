    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users in your AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a temporary code
      from a hardware or virtual MFA device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker can
      gain full access to the user's permissions and potentially cause data breaches,
      data loss, or unauthorized changes to your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      MFA devices and verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane, then click on a specific user.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section.
    - Follow the steps to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
    - Repeat for all IAM users without MFA enabled.
