    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to ensure
      data is not exposed to the internet. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a security risk as they allow anyone
      on the internet to access the data. This can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access settings enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI to list bucket permissions and check for public access
      configurations.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings.
    - Enable bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to
      only authorized users.
