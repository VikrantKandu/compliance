    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information and
      complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab to ensure that 'Block all
      public access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' and verify
        that no ACL grants public access.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>' and ensure
        that the policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run 'aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private'
        to set the bucket ACL to private.
    - Use AWS CLI: Run 'aws s3api delete-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>' to
        remove any bucket policy allowing public access.
