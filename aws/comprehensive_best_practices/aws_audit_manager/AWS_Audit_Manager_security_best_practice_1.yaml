    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      more than one form of verification to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect sensitive AWS resources from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA device' column to confirm that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user and choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
