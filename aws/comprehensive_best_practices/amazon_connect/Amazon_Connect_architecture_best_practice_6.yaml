    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access,
      ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and compliance
      violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data
      integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any bucket with public access enabled.
    - Check bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Edit the bucket permissions and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
