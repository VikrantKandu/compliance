  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are launched with IAM roles
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched with an appropriate IAM
      role attached to manage permissions securely. This helps in granting necessary
      permissions to applications running on the instances without using hardcoded
      credentials.
  - Rationale: Launching EC2 instances without IAM roles can lead to security risks
      as applications may require access to AWS services. Hardcoding credentials within
      the application is insecure and can lead to credential leaks. Using IAM roles
      ensures that permissions are managed centrally and securely.
  - Audit: To verify compliance, list all EC2 instances and check if an IAM role is
      associated with each instance. Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to
      inspect the IAM role field for each instance.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched without an IAM role unless
      specified during the instance setup.
  - Remediation: If an EC2 instance is found without an IAM role, assign an appropriate
      IAM role to the instance. This can be done by stopping the instance, attaching
      the role, and then restarting the instance. Ensure the IAM role has the necessary
      permissions for the instance's operations.
