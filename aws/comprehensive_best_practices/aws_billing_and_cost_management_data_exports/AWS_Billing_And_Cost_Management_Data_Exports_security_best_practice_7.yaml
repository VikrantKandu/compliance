    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in the AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the protection
      of AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      resources, even if an account password is compromised. Without MFA, the risk
      of unauthorized access increases significantly, potentially leading to data
      breaches or unauthorized changes to infrastructure.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - Review the "MFA" column for each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users" and choose the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab, then click "Manage" next to "Assigned
      MFA device".
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
