    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. It is crucial to configure
      S3 bucket permissions carefully to prevent data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' on the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best practices.
