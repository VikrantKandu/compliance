  - ID: AWS-IAM-001
  - Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles rather than directly
      to individual users to simplify management and enhance security. This practice
      minimizes the risk of inadvertently granting excessive permissions to users.
  - Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures and increased risk of privilege escalation. By using groups or roles,
      permissions can be managed more effectively and consistently, reducing the likelihood
      of errors and improving security posture.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Review each user to ensure no
      policies are directly attached. 5. Check that policies are attached to groups
      or roles instead.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups,
      or roles.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify any IAM policies directly attached to users. 2. Detach
      these policies from users. 3. Create or use existing groups or roles to attach
      the necessary policies. 4. Add users to the appropriate groups or assign roles
      as needed.
