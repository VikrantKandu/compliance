    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored within them. This
      can lead to data exposure, loss of sensitive information, and potential regulatory
      compliance issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that no buckets have a policy allowing public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove public
      access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
