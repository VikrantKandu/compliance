    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI to list bucket policies: aws s3api get-bucket-policy
        --bucket bucket-name
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
