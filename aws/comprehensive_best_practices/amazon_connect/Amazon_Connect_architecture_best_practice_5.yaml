    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized public access to sensitive data stored in the
      cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates
      these risks by restricting access to only authorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access settings enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires modification.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Save the changes to update the bucket settings.
