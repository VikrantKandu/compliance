    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Regularly update EC2 instances to use the latest Amazon Machine Images
      (AMIs) to ensure they have the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose EC2 instances to vulnerabilities that
      have been addressed in newer versions. Regular updates minimize the risk of
      exploitation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the "Instances" option.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID and compare it against the latest AMI versions
      available in the AWS Marketplace or your custom AMIs.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMIs unless
      manually updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the latest AMI version for your operating system and application requirements.
    - Plan and execute a schedule to update existing EC2 instances to the latest AMIs.
    - Consider using automation tools like AWS Systems Manager or AWS Lambda to automate
      the update process.
