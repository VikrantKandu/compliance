    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of identification,
      in addition to their password, when accessing AWS services. This helps protect
      AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled by verifying that the 'MFA device'
      column shows a device is assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
