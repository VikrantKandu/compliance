    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users
      to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts
      by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential loss of sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service and choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
