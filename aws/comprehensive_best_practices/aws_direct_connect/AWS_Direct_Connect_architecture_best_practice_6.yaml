  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to enhance
      security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection on top of the username
      and password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to
      unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial and reputational
      damage.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      Credentials' tab. 5. Verify that 'Assigned MFA Device' is set for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security Credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the steps to assign an MFA
      device to the user.
