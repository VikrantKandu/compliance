  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security to the AWS environment. MFA requires
      users to present two or more separate forms of identification before they can
      access sensitive resources.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, the risk of unauthorized
      access increases, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions
      within the AWS account.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user to verify if
      MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that the 'Security credentials' tab shows 'Assigned
      MFA device'.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts
      to assign an MFA device to the user. 8. Repeat the process for all users without
      MFA enabled.
