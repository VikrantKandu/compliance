  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can pose a security risk. Custom security groups with specific inbound and outbound
      rules should be used to control traffic.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintentional exposure
      of resources to the public internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that no instance is associated with the
      default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be associated with the default security
      group, which allows all traffic.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify the EC2 instances using the default security group. 2.
      Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per
      your security requirements. 3. Associate the EC2 instances with the newly created
      security group. 4. Remove the association with the default security group.
