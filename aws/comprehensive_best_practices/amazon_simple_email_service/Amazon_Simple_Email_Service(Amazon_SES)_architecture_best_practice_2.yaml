    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      to prevent unauthorized access. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required for business purposes.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      review the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to review the bucket's policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict
      public access.
    - Remove any public access granted through the bucket policy or ACLs.
    - Consider enabling 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
