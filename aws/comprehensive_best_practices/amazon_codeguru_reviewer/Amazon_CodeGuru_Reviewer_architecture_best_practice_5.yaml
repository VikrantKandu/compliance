    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible,
      you reduce the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Check the "Access" column for any buckets marked as "Public".
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove
      public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to restrict public access at the bucket
      level.
