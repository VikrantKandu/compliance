    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker can gain full access to the account. MFA adds an additional security
      layer, requiring a physical or virtual device.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by selecting the Security Credentials
      tab and verifying the status under Assigned MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security Credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
