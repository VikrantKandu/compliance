    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption encrypts data stored
      in S3, providing an additional layer of data protection.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and meets compliance requirements for data protection.
      Without encryption, data stored in S3 could be vulnerable to unauthorized access
      and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check the Default Encryption section to verify if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the Properties tab and select Default Encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to enable server-side encryption for the bucket.
