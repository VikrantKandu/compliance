    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to data. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public mitigates the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that all public access settings are enabled.
    - Check bucket permissions and policies for any statements allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Config or AWS Trusted Advisor to identify and remediate publicly accessible
      buckets.
