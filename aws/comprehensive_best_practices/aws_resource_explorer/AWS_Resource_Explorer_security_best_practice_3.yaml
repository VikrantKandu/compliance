    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password by requiring
      an additional authentication factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data breaches,
      unauthorized resource usage, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the left-hand menu.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <user-name> to verify MFA status for
        each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the left-hand menu.
    - Click on a user to view details.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to "Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)".
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
