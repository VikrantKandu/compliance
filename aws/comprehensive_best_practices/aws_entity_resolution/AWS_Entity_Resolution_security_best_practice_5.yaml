    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive information to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose data to anyone on the internet. This can lead to data breaches,
      loss of sensitive information, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access configuration.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings in the S3 console to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
