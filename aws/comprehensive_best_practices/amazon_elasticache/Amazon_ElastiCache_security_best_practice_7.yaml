    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to data breaches. Restricting access to only required
      users or services minimizes this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that requires remediation.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
