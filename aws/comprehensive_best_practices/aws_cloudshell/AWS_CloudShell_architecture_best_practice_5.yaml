    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data leaks and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data exposure and enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
