  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions. Publicly
      accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access mitigates the risk
      of data breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions tab.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
