    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, restricting public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data and increase the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets can be configured to allow public access. If
      not properly managed, this can lead to unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
