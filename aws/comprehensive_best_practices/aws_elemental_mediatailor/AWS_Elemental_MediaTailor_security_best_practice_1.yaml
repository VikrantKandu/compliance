    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Restricting public access minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access granted via bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
