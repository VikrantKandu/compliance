    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS root account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires not only a password
      but also a secondary form of verification, which significantly reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access, even if the root account password is compromised. Without MFA, the root
      account is vulnerable to attacks, which can lead to unauthorized changes, data
      exposure, or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the AccountMFAEnabled field for a value of 1.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA using a virtual MFA device or
      a hardware MFA device.
