    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. By restricting public access, organizations can protect sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI commands to update the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure no public
      access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
