    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in All Regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to provide a
      complete audit trail of account activity.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that all API calls and actions
      are logged, providing comprehensive visibility into account activity and aiding
      in security and compliance efforts. Without this, unauthorized activities may
      go undetected.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the CloudTrail console.
    - Step 3: Verify that a trail is created and is logging events in all regions.
    - Step 4: Confirm that the trail is configured to log management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Go to the CloudTrail console.
    - Step 3: Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Step 4: Ensure the trail is set to log both management and data events.
    - Step 5: Save the changes to activate the trail across all regions.
