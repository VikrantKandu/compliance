    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      protects sensitive information and complies with data privacy regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that the 'Block
      all public access' settings are enabled. 5. Check bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Enable 'Block all public access' for each S3 bucket. 2. Review
      and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
