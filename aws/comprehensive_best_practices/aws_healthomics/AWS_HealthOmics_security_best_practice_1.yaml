    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users but are instead attached to groups or roles. This practice
      simplifies policy management and enhances security by ensuring permissions are
      granted based on roles or group membership.
    Rationale: Directly attaching policies to individual users can lead to complex
      and error-prone permission management. By attaching policies to groups or roles,
      it is easier to manage permissions consistently and reduce the risk of excessive
      permissions being granted inadvertently.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left panel.
    - Review each user to ensure no policies are directly attached.
    - Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups, or roles
      by default.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any users with directly attached policies.
    - Detach policies from users and reattach them to appropriate groups or roles.
    - Ensure users are added to the correct groups or roles to inherit necessary permissions.
