    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which means no public read or write access is granted to buckets or objects.
      This is crucial for maintaining data privacy and security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of exposing sensitive information to the public.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Access Control List (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to maintain compliance.
