    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency and security across the
      environment.
    Rationale: Using unapproved or outdated AMIs can lead to security vulnerabilities,
      inconsistent system configurations, and potential compliance issues. Approved
      AMIs are vetted for security and compliance, ensuring that instances are provisioned
      with the latest security patches and configurations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running instances and identify the AMI ID associated with each instance.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by your
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      AMI or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running with unapproved AMIs.
    - Create or identify an approved AMI that meets security and compliance requirements.
    - Re-launch or migrate instances using the approved AMI.
    - Update internal documentation to reflect the approved AMI list and ensure all
      future instances are launched using these AMIs.
