    Title: Ensure that EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unauthorized
      access and potential attacks, as it allows unrestricted inbound and outbound
      traffic. This can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group, which
      allows all traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance using the default security group, click on 'Actions', then
      'Networking', and 'Change Security Groups'.
    - Select a custom security group with restrictive rules and click 'Assign Security
      Groups'.
