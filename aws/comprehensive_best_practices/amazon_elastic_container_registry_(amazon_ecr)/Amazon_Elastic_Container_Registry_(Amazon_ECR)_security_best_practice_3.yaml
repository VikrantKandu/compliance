    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Public
      S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security
      risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information
      and maintain data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket's ACL (Access Control List) settings do not grant public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket policies and ACLs to programmatically
      check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Update the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
