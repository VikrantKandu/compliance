    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that no bucket allows public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and check for any public grants.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the "Block public access" settings.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if it is not already enabled.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
