    Title: Ensure EC2 instances have a security group attached
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances have at least one security group attached
      to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups act as a virtual firewall
      for your instance to control traffic.
    Rationale: Security groups are essential for managing access to EC2 instances.
      Without a security group, instances may be exposed to unauthorized access, leading
      to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check if there is a security group listed under the 'Security
      groups' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the 'SecurityGroups' attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances require at least one security group at
      launch.
    Remediation:
    - If an instance does not have a security group, navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select the instance and choose 'Actions', then 'Networking', and 'Change Security
      Groups'.
    - Attach an existing security group or create a new one with appropriate rules.
    - Apply the changes to ensure the instance is protected.
