    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      resources, even if an account's password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to attacks, increasing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      actions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Review each user to ensure that
      'MFA enabled' is set to 'Yes'.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select a user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7.
      Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
