    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      restricting public access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring S3 buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the Access column to ensure it is set
      to "Private".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the ACL settings are private.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
