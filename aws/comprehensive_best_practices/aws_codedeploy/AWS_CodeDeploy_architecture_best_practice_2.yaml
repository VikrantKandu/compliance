  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
      over the internet. Publicly accessible instances can be a security risk as they
      are exposed to potential attacks from unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Limiting access to EC2 instances reduces the attack surface of your
      infrastructure. Publicly accessible instances are vulnerable to various attacks,
      including brute force and exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Check the security groups associated with each EC2 instance. 4. Verify that
      the inbound rules do not allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) on any port.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with security groups
      that allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances with security groups allowing public access.
      2. Modify the security groups to restrict access by specifying allowed IP addresses
      or using a VPN. 3. Consider using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure,
      private access to instances.
