  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers to
      access sensitive information or disrupt services.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no buckets have public access unless specifically required.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL of each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access statements.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the requirement for public
      access.
    - Remove any unnecessary public access permissions from the bucket ACL or bucket
      policy.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings to restrict
      public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
