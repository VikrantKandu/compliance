    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public accessibility of S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access, which can result in data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets are vulnerable to unauthorized data
      access, which can result in the loss of sensitive information and potentially
      violate compliance requirements. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      data integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions set via bucket policies or
      Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
