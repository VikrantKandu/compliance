    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling MFA for all IAM users adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring not only a password but also a second form of verification to access
      AWS resources.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS management
      console and APIs by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to phishing and password theft.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA enabled" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage" and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA.
