    Title: Ensure EC2 Security Groups Are Configured Correctly
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances have security groups configured
      to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to only necessary ports and IP addresses.
      Proper configuration of security groups is crucial to protect instances from
      unauthorized access and potential attacks.
    Rationale: Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling
      the inbound and outbound traffic. Improperly configured security groups can
      expose instances to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches
      and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Security Groups' under 'Network & Security'.
    - Review each security group to ensure that only necessary ports and IP addresses
      are allowed for inbound and outbound rules.
    - Verify that no security group allows unrestricted access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) unless
      explicitly required.
    Default Value: By default, newly created security groups allow no inbound traffic
      and allow all outbound traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the security group with non-compliant rules.
    - Edit the security group to remove or modify rules that allow unnecessary traffic.
    - Apply changes and ensure that only the required ports and IP addresses are specified
      for both inbound and outbound traffic.
