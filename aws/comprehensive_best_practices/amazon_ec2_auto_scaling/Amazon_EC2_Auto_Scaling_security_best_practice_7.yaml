    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification. This reduces the
      risk of compromised accounts due to stolen or guessed passwords.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect sensitive AWS resources from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks that
      exploit weak or compromised credentials.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 4. Click
      on the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. Under 'Assigned MFA device', click on
      'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device. 6. Instruct users to
      complete the MFA device setup process.
