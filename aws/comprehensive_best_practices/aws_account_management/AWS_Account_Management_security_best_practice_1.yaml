    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to present two or more separate forms of
      identification before accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      could gain full access to the AWS environment. MFA helps prevent unauthorized
      access even if the user's password is compromised.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the
      "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6.
      In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
      7. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
