    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
      Public access can lead to data leakage, compliance violations, and financial
      loss.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket list and check the Access column for any buckets marked
        as "Public".
    - Step 4: For each bucket, click on the bucket name and select the "Permissions"
        tab.
    - Step 5: Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 5: Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Step 6: Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
