    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data theft or loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket's Block Public Access settings to ensure that public access
      is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket ACLs do not permit public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure bucket policies do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Open the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Choose the Permissions tab.
    - Under Block public access, ensure all options are checked to block public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save the changes to enforce the updated security settings.
