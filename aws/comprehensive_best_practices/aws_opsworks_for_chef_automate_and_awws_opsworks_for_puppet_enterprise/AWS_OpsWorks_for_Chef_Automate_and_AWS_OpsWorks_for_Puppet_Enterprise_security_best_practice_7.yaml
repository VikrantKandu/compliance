    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, which mitigates the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private protects data
      integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to verify
      the access control list.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      review the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and disable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Ensure the bucket policy restricts access to specific IAM users or roles.
