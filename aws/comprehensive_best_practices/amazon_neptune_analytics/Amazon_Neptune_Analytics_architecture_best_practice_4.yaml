    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Sensitive data might be exposed to the internet if proper access
      controls are not in place. This check helps prevent such vulnerabilities by
      ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible by default.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control
      access.
