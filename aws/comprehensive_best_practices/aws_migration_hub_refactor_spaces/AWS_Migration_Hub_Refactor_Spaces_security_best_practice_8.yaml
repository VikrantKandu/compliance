    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides data protection
      by encrypting the data stored in the bucket, ensuring that unauthorized access
      to the raw data is prevented.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets mitigates the risk of
      data exposure. If an unauthorized user gains access to the bucket, encrypted
      data is less likely to be compromised. Without encryption, sensitive data stored
      in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the bucket properties and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) based on your security
      requirements.
    - Save the changes to ensure that all future objects uploaded to the bucket are
      encrypted.
