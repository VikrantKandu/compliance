    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling MFA for all IAM users adds an extra layer of security. It
      requires users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a temporary
      code generated by a physical or virtual MFA device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      as it requires a second factor that is not easily compromised. Without MFA,
      if a password is compromised, an attacker can gain full access to the account.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Check each user to ensure that
      MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA Device' column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts
      to enable and configure MFA for the user.
