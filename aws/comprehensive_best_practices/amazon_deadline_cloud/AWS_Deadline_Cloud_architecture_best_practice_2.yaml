    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling MFA for all IAM users provides an extra layer of security
      by requiring not only a password and username but also a code generated by a
      device that only the user possesses.
    Rationale: Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, which
      can lead to data breaches or unauthorized changes to your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, click on Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
