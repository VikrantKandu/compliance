    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets may be configured to allow public access. This
      can lead to unauthorized access and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and comply with security best
      practices.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions of each bucket. 4. Check for any bucket with 'Public'
      access status. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify access control lists. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket policies for
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon
      S3 service. 3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Adjust the bucket permissions
      to remove public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private to set the bucket ACL to private. 6. Review
      and update bucket policies to ensure they do not allow public access.
