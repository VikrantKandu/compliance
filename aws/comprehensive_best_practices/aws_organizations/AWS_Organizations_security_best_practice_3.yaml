    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users increases the security of your AWS account
      by reducing the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA, an attacker who
      obtains a user's password could gain full access to your AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Check each user to ensure that the 'MFA Device' column indicates that MFA is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab, then 'Manage' in the 'Assigned MFA device'
      section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
