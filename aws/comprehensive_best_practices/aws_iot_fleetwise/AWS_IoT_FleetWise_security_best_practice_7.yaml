    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible minimizes security
      risks and protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket access permissions and ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access is allowed.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove
      any public permissions.
