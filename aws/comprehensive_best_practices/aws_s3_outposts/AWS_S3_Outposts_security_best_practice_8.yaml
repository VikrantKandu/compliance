    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Step 5: Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Step 6: Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
