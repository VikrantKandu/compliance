    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs that are approved
      by the organization. Using approved AMIs ensures instances are built from a
      secure and compliant baseline.
    Rationale: Approved AMIs are vetted for security and compliance. Using unapproved
      AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that pose security
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: List all running EC2 instances across all regions.
    - Step 2: Retrieve the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Step 3: Compare the retrieved AMI IDs against the list of organization-approved
        AMIs.
    - Step 4: Identify instances that are not using approved AMIs.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may be launched with any publicly available AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify the AMI ID of non-compliant EC2 instances.
    - Step 2: Terminate the non-compliant instances.
    - Step 3: Launch new instances using approved AMIs.
    - Step 4: Update deployment processes to ensure only approved AMIs are used in
        future deployments.
