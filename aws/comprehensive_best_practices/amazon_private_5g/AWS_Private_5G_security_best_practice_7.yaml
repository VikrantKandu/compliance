  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Public access can lead to sensitive data being exposed to the
      internet.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks by restricting access to only authorized users.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings. Ensure that all options are enabled to block public access.
      5. Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public
      access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access, but this setting
      can be changed.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all
      public access" settings. 5. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      any public access permissions.
