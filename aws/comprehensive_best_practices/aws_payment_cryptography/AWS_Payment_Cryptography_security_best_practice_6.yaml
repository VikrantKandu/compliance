    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and the bucket policy.
    - Verify that the bucket is not publicly accessible by ensuring that the 'Block
      all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Review the bucket policy using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket's permissions
      to block public access.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting within the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket configurations to ensure compliance with best practices.
