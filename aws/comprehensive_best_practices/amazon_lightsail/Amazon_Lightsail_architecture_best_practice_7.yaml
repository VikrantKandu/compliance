    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet and increase
      the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is critical to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public buckets can lead to data leaks and potential
      exploitation of exposed data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    - Ensure the block public access settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Save the changes to apply the updated permissions.
