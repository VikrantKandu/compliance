    Title: Ensure CloudFormation stacks have termination protection enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Termination protection for CloudFormation stacks prevents accidental
      deletion, protecting resources and configurations from unintended disruptions.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection helps safeguard critical infrastructure
      by preventing accidental deletion of CloudFormation stacks. Without it, stacks
      can be deleted by mistake, leading to potential downtime, data loss, and security
      vulnerabilities.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select each stack and check if termination protection is enabled.
      4. Use the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation describe-stacks to programmatically
      verify the termination protection status for each stack.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stacks do not have termination protection
      enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select the stack you want to protect. 4. Click on the Stack Actions
      dropdown and select 'Enable Termination Protection'. 5. Confirm the action to
      enable termination protection.
