    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption automatically encrypts
      data when it is written to a bucket and decrypts it when it is accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data stored in
      S3 is vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access, potentially leading
      to data loss or exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and click on each bucket.
    - Check the "Properties" tab for each bucket.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled and configured with the desired
      encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket to be configured.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," select "Enable" and choose the desired encryption
      method.
    - Save changes to ensure server-side encryption is applied to all new objects
      in the bucket.
