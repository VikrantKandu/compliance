    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user sign-in credentials. By requiring users to provide a second form of
      authentication, MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and security
      incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the MFA status for each IAM user.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all IAM users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
