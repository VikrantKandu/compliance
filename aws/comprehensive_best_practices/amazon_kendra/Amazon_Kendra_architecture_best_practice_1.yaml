    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data
      exposure and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to gain access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure there
      are no public access permissions.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS Config or AWS Trusted Advisor to identify publicly accessible buckets.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review and update bucket policies to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Modify bucket ACLs to ensure there are no public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access to buckets and
      objects.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
