    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      data theft, or data manipulation. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of unintended data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and public access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access statements.
    - Adjust ACLs to restrict access to specific AWS accounts or IAM roles.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
