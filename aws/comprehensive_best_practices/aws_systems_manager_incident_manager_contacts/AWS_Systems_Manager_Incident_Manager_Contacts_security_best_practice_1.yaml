    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to AWS accounts by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This practice helps protect accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials and unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, which can lead to data breaches and other security
      incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the Security Credentials
      tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, click on the Security Credentials tab.
    - Follow the steps to enable MFA for each user.
