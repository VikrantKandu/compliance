    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. Enabling MFA adds an
      extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      typically a code from a hardware or virtual MFA device, in addition to their
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the user's permissions. By requiring MFA, even if a password
      is compromised, the attacker would need the additional factor to gain access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list all MFA devices and verify that each user has an associated MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to use MFA.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user, then choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage' to assign an MFA device
      to the user.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure the MFA device.
