    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      protects against unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket policies and ACLs to
      confirm no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies to remove any public access permissions.
