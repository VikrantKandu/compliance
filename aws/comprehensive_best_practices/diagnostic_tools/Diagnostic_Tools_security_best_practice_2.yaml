    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and ensure the bucket policy
      and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access permissions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api delete-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to remove any public bucket policy.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket ACL to remove public access permissions
      using aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private.
