    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of
      unauthorized data access in the event of a data breach.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets protects sensitive data
      by ensuring that it is encrypted when stored. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to data
      breaches and compromise of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the properties of each bucket.
    - Ensure that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket by checking the
      "Default encryption" setting.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is non-compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab of the bucket.
    - Under "Default encryption," select the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256
      or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to enable server-side encryption for the bucket.
