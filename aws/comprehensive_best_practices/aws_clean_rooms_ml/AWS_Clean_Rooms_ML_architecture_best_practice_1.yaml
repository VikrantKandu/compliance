  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leakage. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Check the "Public access
      settings" to ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the ACL
      does not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public
      access". 4. Enable 'Block all public access' settings. 5. Save the changes to
      ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
