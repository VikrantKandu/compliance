    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity. Unauthorized access to publicly available buckets
      can result in data leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings for each bucket and ensure all options
      are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
