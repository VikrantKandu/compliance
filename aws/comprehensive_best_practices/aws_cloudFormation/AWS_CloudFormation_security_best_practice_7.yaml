    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA provides an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials by requiring a second form
      of authentication. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions within AWS
      resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select each user and check the
      "Security credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that the "Assigned
      MFA device" field is populated for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In
      the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
      7. Follow the instructions to assign and activate the MFA device.
