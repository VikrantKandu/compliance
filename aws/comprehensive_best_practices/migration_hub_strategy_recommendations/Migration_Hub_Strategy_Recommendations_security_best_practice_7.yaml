    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled to
      protect data at rest. This best practice helps safeguard sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
      access and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to exposure in the event of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the properties of each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab.
    - Under the Default Encryption section, select the desired encryption option (e.g.,
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to enable encryption for the bucket.
