    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail provides visibility into user activity by recording actions
      taken on your account, which is crucial for security and compliance. Ensuring
      CloudTrail is enabled in all regions helps in tracking changes and detecting
      anomalies.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that all activity is logged,
      which is essential for detecting unauthorized access or changes. Without it,
      you might miss critical security events that occur in regions where CloudTrail
      is not enabled.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Check if there is at least one trail configured for each region.
    - Verify that the trails are logging management events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or update an existing one to cover all regions.
    - Ensure that management events are being logged for each region.
