    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data
      leaks and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors to access sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the bucket policy editor in the AWS Management Console to restrict access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update IAM policies to ensure they do not grant unnecessary public
      access.
