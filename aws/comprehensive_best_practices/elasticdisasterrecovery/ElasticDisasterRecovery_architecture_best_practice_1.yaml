    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires not only
      a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e.,
      a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand - such
      as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is critical because it adds an extra
      layer of security. If the root account is compromised, an attacker could potentially
      gain full access to all resources in the account, leading to data loss, service
      disruption, and increased costs. MFA helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the "Security Status" section for the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with the root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the "Security Status" section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the root account.
