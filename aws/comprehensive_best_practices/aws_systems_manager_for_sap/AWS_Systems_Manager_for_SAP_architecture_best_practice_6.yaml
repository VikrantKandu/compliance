    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance account security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, which adds an additional layer of security
      beyond just a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
      If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who obtains a user's password could gain
      access to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces the risk of such breaches
      by requiring a second factor of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to see if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to programmatically
      check for MFA devices associated with IAM users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user and go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and enable an MFA device for the user.
