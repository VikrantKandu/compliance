  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could lead to data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive data and
      comply with data protection regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to list bucket policies and check for public access settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public-read or public-read-write
      permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
