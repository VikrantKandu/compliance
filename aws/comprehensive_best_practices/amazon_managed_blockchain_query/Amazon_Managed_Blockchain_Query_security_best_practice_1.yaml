    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to
      be private and not publicly accessible. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private
      helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to only
      authorized users mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
    Remediation:
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block new public access settings.
    - Regularly review and update the bucket policies to ensure compliance with best
      practices.
