    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users
      to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect your AWS environment from unauthorized access. Without MFA, if an IAM
      user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to your AWS
      resources.
    Audit:
      Steps:
      - Log into the AWS Management Console.
      - Navigate to the IAM service.
      - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
      - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
      - 'Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
        to list users without MFA.'
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
      Steps:
      - Log into the AWS Management Console.
      - Navigate to the IAM service.
      - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
      - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
      - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
      - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
      - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device to the user.
