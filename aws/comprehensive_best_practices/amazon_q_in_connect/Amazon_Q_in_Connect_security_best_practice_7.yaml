    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be easily exploited by
      malicious actors, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring
      that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data exposure and
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Public' access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and review the output to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove
      public access.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting for the bucket.
