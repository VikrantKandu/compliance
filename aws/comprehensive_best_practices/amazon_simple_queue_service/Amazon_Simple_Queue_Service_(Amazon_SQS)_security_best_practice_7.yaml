    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to provide a second form of authentication, in addition to
      their password, which helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, a stolen password can lead
      to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial and reputational
      damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA Device and follow the prompts to enable MFA.
    - Ensure that users are instructed on how to set up and use their MFA devices.
