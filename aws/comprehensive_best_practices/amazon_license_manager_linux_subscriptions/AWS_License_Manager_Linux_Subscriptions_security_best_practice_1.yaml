    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block Public Access' settings
      are enabled for all buckets.
    - Confirm that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly review bucket configurations to ensure compliance.
