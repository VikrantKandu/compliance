    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Publicly exposed buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Verify the Block Public Access settings are enabled at both the account and
      bucket levels.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, immediately update the bucket
      policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update any IAM policies that might grant public access to the bucket.
