    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can expose instances to unnecessary risk
      by allowing unrestricted access. It is important to define specific security
      group rules to control traffic and enhance security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Security Groups from the left-hand menu.
    - Identify any security groups that are set as default.
    - Verify that no EC2 instances are associated with these default security groups.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific rules that meet your security requirements.
    - Detach the default security group from any EC2 instances.
    - Attach the newly created security group to those instances.
