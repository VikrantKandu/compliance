    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict access to ensure
      data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select a bucket.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Under 'Block public access', enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
