    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to the
      authentication process by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.
      Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials leading to unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to resources. Enabling MFA significantly mitigates this risk
      by requiring the attacker to also have access to the MFA device.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws
      iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>' to verify MFA devices for each
      user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
    - Ensure all users have MFA enabled by repeating the process for each user.
