    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encrypting data helps protect
      sensitive information from unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets ensures that data is
      automatically encrypted when stored and decrypted when accessed by authorized
      users. Failure to encrypt data at rest can lead to unauthorized access and data
      breaches, especially if the data is sensitive or confidential.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check the Default Encryption section to verify if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable Default Encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    - Save changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
