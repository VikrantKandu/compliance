    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. Ensuring buckets are not public
      helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential data
      leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket to ensure public access
      is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
