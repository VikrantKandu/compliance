    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFront distributions enforce HTTPS
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFront distributions require
      HTTPS for all communications between clients and the CloudFront edge locations.
      Enforcing HTTPS ensures that data in transit is encrypted, providing confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Rationale: Enforcing HTTPS helps protect data in transit from being intercepted
      by attackers. Without HTTPS, sensitive information could be exposed, leading
      to data breaches or unauthorized access. This check is crucial for maintaining
      the security and privacy of data transmitted through CloudFront.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFront
      service. 3. Select each distribution and check the 'Viewer Protocol Policy'
      setting. 4. Ensure that the 'Viewer Protocol Policy' is set to 'Redirect HTTP
      to HTTPS' or 'HTTPS Only'.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFront distributions do not enforce HTTPS.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFront
      service. 3. Select the distribution you want to update. 4. Go to the 'Behaviors'
      tab and edit the behavior settings. 5. Change the 'Viewer Protocol Policy' to
      'Redirect HTTP to HTTPS' or 'HTTPS Only'. 6. Save the changes and deploy the
      updated configuration.
