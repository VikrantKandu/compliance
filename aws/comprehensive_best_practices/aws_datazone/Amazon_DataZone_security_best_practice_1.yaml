    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled. Encryption helps protect data at rest by encrypting it with a key that
      can be managed by AWS or the customer.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Without encryption, data is stored in plain text,
      making it vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if 'Default Encryption' is enabled. Verify that either AWS-managed keys
      (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS) are used.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable 'Default Encryption'.
    - Choose either AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS) for
      encryption.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
