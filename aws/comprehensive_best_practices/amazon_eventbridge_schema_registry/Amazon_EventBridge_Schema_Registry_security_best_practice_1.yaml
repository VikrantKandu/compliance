    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure, which can
      result in data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data leakage and helps maintain
      compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket settings if necessary.
