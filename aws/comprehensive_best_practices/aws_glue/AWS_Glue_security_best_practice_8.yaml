  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized users. Public access can lead to data breaches and data loss.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions of each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and check for any
        entries with "AllUsers" or "AuthenticatedUsers".
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and remove any statements granting public access.
    - Ensure the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI to update bucket policy: aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        --policy <policy-json> to remove public access.
