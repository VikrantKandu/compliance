    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or unintended
      data exposure. Restricting access helps protect sensitive information and comply
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy to programmatically check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
