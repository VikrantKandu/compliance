    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions
      that can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Limiting access reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly monitor S3 access logs and bucket policies for changes.
