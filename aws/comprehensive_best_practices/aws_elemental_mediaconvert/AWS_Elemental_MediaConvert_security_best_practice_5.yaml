    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to your AWS account by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication. Without MFA, accounts
      are more susceptible to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on a user and select the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), click Manage and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA for the user.
