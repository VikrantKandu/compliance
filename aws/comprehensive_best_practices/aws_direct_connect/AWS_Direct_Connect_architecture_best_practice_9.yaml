    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security to your AWS accounts by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication. This helps protect against
      compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access and
      reduces the risk of security breaches. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials
      are compromised, attackers can gain full access to your AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check if 'MFA
      Device' is assigned under the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. Verify that all
      users have an MFA device enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane. 4. Select a user and go to the 'Security
      credentials' tab. 5. Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA for the user.
