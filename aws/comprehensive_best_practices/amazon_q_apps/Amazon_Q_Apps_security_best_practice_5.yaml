    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide not only a password but also a second
      form of authentication, such as a code from a smartphone app or a hardware token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data breaches,
      unauthorized resource usage, and other security incidents. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security beyond just a password.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select each user to view their 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that 'Assigned MFA device' is listed for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab, then 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
