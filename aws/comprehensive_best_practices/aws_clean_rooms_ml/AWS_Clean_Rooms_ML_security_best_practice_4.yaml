    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. By default, S3 buckets should
      be private, and access should be restricted to specific users or roles.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Public" indicator for each bucket.
    - For each bucket, click on "Permissions" and verify that "Block all public access"
      is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      check for any permissions granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
