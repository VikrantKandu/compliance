    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of your username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect
      your AWS resources by requiring an additional piece of information to authenticate.
    Rationale: MFA significantly increases the security of user sign-in by requiring
      an additional factor that only the user possesses. Without MFA, if a password
      is compromised, the account is vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA device" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
      check the output for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)", choose "Assign MFA device".
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
