    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use server-side
      encryption to protect data at rest, which is a critical security measure to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information from being
      accessed by unauthorized users. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, especially if the access controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
        <bucket-name> to ensure encryption is configured.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," select "Enable" and choose the desired encryption
      option (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to ensure encryption is applied to new objects by default.
