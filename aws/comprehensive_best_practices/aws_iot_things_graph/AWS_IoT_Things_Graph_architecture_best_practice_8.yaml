    Title: Ensure EC2 instances have security groups with restricted inbound access
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances have security groups configured
      to restrict inbound traffic to only necessary ports and IP addresses. This minimizes
      the attack surface and helps protect instances from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Restricting inbound access reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities. Without proper security group
      configurations, instances may be exposed to unnecessary risks, leading to data
      breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the 'Security Groups' associated with each instance.
    - Verify that inbound rules are limited to specific IP addresses and ports necessary
      for the application.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may have security groups with open inbound
      access, depending on the initial configuration.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances with overly permissive security groups.
    - Modify security group rules to restrict inbound traffic to only trusted IP addresses
      and necessary ports.
    - Regularly review and update security group configurations to align with security
      policies.
