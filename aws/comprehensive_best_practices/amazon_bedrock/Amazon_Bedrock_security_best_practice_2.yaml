    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      access and data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data,
      leading to compliance violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent any future
      public access configurations.
