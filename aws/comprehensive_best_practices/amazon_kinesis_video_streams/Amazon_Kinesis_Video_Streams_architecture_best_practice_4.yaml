    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure, data theft, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow
      public access. 6. Use AWS CLI or SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs to confirm
      the settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab and review the bucket policy and ACL. 5. Remove any statements in the bucket
      policy that allow public access. 6. Set the bucket ACL to private by removing
      any public access grants. 7. Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access feature
      to prevent public access at the account or bucket level.
