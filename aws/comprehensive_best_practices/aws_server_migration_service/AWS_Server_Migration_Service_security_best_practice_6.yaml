    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFront distributions are using secure protocols
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFront distributions are configured
      to use secure protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Using secure
      protocols helps protect sensitive data from interception and tampering.
    Rationale: Using insecure protocols can expose data to interception and man-in-the-middle
      attacks. Ensuring secure protocols are in place helps maintain data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select each distribution and check the "Origin Protocol Policy" and "Viewer
      Protocol Policy" settings.
    - Ensure that these settings are configured to use HTTPS.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFront allows both HTTP and HTTPS, but it's recommended
      to enforce HTTPS only.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select the distribution to be modified.
    - Change the "Origin Protocol Policy" and "Viewer Protocol Policy" to enforce
      HTTPS only.
    - Save the changes and confirm the distribution update.
