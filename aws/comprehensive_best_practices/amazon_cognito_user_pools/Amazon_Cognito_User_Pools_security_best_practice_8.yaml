    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are attached to groups or roles
      instead of individual users. Attaching policies to groups or roles simplifies
      management and enhances security by ensuring consistent policy application.
    Rationale: Attaching IAM policies directly to individual users can lead to policy
      sprawl and inconsistent permissions, increasing the risk of excessive permissions
      and potential security breaches. By using groups or roles, permissions are more
      manageable and can be audited more effectively.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM console.
      3. Review the list of IAM users and check if any have policies directly attached.
      4. Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies may be attached to individual users, groups,
      or roles.
    Remediation: 1. Identify IAM users with directly attached policies. 2. Create
      or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles. 3. Attach the policies to these
      groups or roles. 4. Add the users to the groups or assign them the roles. 5.
      Remove direct policy attachments from users.
