    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors, leading to data leaks or unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy or ACL.
