    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and
      lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to steal or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Edit" under "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
