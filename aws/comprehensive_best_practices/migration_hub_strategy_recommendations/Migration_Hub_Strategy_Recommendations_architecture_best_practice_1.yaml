  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive
      information.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default reduces the risk of accidental
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to gain access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
      violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no
      public access permissions granted. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> and verify that the ACL does not allow public access.
      5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab and edit the bucket policy
      to remove any public access permissions. 4. Adjust the bucket ACL to remove
      any public access grants. 5. Enable the "Block all public access" setting for
      the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
