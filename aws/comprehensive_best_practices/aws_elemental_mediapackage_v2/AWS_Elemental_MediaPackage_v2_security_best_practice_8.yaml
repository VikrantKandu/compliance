  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information, potentially resulting in compliance violations
      and reputational damage.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Check that the bucket's ACL and bucket policy do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public permissions are granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure no public access is allowed.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions in the bucket's ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to deny public access.
    - Utilize AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions.
