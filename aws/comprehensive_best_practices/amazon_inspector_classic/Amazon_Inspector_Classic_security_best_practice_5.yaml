    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure,
      unauthorized access, and compliance violations. Restricting public access minimizes
      these risks and enhances data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and
      ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the bucket's access
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
