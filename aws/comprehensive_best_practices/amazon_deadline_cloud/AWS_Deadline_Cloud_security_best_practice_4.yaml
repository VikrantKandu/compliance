    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption ensures that data stored
      in S3 is automatically encrypted and decrypted as it is stored and retrieved.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial for protecting
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with data protection
      regulations. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-encryption' to
      check the encryption status of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
