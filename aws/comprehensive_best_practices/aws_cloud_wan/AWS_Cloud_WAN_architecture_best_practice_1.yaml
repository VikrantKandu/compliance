    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public" access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access policies or settings.
    - Ensure the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
