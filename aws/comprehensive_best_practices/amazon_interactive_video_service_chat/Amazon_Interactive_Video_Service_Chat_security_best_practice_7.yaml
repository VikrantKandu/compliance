    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to provide an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances the security of AWS
      accounts by requiring a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA' is enabled in the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security Credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
