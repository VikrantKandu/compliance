    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using EBS Volumes with Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes attached
      to EC2 instances are encrypted to protect sensitive data at rest. Encryption
      helps protect data confidentiality and integrity by preventing unauthorized
      access to the data on the volume.
    Rationale: Encrypting EBS volumes is crucial for protecting sensitive data from
      unauthorized access, especially in the event of a security breach. Unencrypted
      volumes could lead to data leakage and compromise sensitive information if accessed
      by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the attached EBS volumes.
    - Verify that the Encryption field for each volume is set to 'Enabled'.
    Default Value: By default, EBS volumes are not encrypted unless specified during
      creation.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance with unencrypted volumes, create a snapshot of the volume.
    - Copy the snapshot with the encryption option enabled.
    - Create a new EBS volume from the encrypted snapshot.
    - Detach the unencrypted volume and attach the new encrypted volume to the instance.
