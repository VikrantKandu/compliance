    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket does not have public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but settings may be changed
      by users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access."
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
