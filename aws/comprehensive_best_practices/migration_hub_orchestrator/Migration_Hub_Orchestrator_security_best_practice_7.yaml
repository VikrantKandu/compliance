  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they
      do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
