    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should be launched using the latest Amazon Machine
      Image (AMI) to ensure they include the latest security patches and updates.
      Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have been addressed
      in newer versions.
    Rationale: Utilizing the latest AMI helps to mitigate security risks associated
      with outdated software and unpatched vulnerabilities. Regularly updating AMIs
      ensures that instances have the latest security enhancements and performance
      improvements.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the AMI ID and compare it with the latest available
        AMI ID in the AWS Marketplace or your custom AMI catalog.
    Default Value: Instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless manually
      updated.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Identify the latest AMI ID for your instance type and region.
    - Action 2: Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Action 3: Migrate applications and data to the new instance.
    - Action 4: Terminate the old instance once the new instance is fully operational.
