    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security by
      requiring an additional layer of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access due to compromised passwords.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the steps to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device to the
      user.
