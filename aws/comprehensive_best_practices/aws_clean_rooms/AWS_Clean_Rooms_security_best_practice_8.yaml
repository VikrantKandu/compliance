    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data
      stored in the bucket is encrypted at rest, protecting it from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Encrypting data at rest
      adds an additional layer of security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is set to "Enable" with a valid encryption
      option (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption."
    - Choose the desired encryption method, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
