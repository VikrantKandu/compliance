    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security by requiring an
      additional form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring
      a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if
      credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
        to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
