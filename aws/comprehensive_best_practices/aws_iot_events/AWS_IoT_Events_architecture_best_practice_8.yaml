    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS IAM password policies are configured to enforce strong
      password practices. This includes setting requirements for minimum password
      length, complexity, and expiration to enhance security.
    Rationale: Strong password policies reduce the risk of unauthorized access to
      AWS accounts by ensuring that passwords are difficult to guess or crack. Weak
      or default passwords can be easily compromised, leading to potential security
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets the organization's security
      requirements, such as minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Account settings'.
    - Enable and configure the password policy to meet the organization's security
      requirements, such as setting a minimum password length, requiring at least
      one number and special character, and setting a password expiration period.
