    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles instead of directly
      to individual users. This practice simplifies management and enhances security
      by ensuring that permissions are consistently applied and easily modified.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures that are difficult to manage and audit. It increases the risk of
      excessive permissions and potential security vulnerabilities. By attaching policies
      to groups or roles, you can enforce the principle of least privilege and simplify
      permission management.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Inspect the list of users and check if any user has policies attached directly.
      4. Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation: 1. Detach any policies that are directly attached to users. 2. Create
      groups or roles as necessary. 3. Attach the necessary policies to these groups
      or roles. 4. Add users to the appropriate groups or assign the necessary roles
      to ensure they have the required permissions.
