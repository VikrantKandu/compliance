    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and is a critical security measure.
    Rationale: Server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data is encrypted
      at rest, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Without
      encryption, sensitive data stored in S3 is vulnerable to exposure if access
      controls are bypassed or misconfigured.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the Properties tab. 4. Under the Default
      Encryption section, verify that server-side encryption is enabled. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that requires encryption. 4. Click on the Properties tab.
      5. Under the Default Encryption section, select 'Enable' and choose the desired
      encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS). 6. Save the changes to apply encryption
      to the bucket.
