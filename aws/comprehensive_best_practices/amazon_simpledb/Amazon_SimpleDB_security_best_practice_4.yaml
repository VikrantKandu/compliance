    Title: Ensure EC2 Volumes are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon EC2 volumes are encrypted to protect
      sensitive data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard your data by using secure
      protocols to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Encrypting EC2 volumes is crucial for protecting sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential breaches. Unencrypted volumes may expose sensitive
      information if accessed by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Volumes" from the left-hand menu.
    - Check the "Encryption" column to verify that all volumes are encrypted.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 volumes are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Identify unencrypted volumes in the EC2 dashboard.
    - Create a snapshot of the unencrypted volume.
    - Create a new encrypted volume from the snapshot.
    - Detach the unencrypted volume and attach the new encrypted volume to the instance.
