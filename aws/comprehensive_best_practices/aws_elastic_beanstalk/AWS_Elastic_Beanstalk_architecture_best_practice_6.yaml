    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps to secure
      AWS accounts by requiring additional verification before granting access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to compromise through
      phishing attacks or password leaks. Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device.
