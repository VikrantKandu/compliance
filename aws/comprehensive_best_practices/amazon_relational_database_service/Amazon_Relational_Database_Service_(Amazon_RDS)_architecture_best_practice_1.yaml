    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Public buckets can potentially expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to compliance violations and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, enable the "Block all public
      access" setting.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Consider using bucket policies or IAM roles to provide the necessary permissions
      securely.
