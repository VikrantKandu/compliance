    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      verify that the ACL does not allow public access.
    - Check bucket policies using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' on the S3 bucket settings.
    - Remove any public permissions from the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
