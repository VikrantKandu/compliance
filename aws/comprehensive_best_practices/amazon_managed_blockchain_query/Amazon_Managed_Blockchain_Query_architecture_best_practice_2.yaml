    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to unauthorized data access, data leaks, and compliance violations.
      Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the attack surface.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the Amazon S3 console.
      3. In the Buckets list, review the Access column for each bucket. 4. For each
      bucket, check the bucket policies and ACLs for any public access permissions.
      5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Identify buckets with public access and evaluate the necessity
      of this access. 2. If public access is not required, modify the bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove public access permissions. 3. Use the S3 Block Public Access
      feature to prevent future public access configurations. 4. Regularly review
      bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
