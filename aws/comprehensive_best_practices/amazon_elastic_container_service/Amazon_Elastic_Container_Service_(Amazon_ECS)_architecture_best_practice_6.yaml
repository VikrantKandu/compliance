    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions and bucket policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access permissions or policies that
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policies and permissions to remove any public access.
    - Enable block public access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
