    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      increasing the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks and helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all
      public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
