    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, such as a code from a phone or hardware token,
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the account. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Users."
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with and without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Users."
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage" and follow the instructions
      to assign an MFA device.
