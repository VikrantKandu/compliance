    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an additional layer of security to user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of user accounts by requiring a
      second form of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. If MFA
      is not enabled, user accounts are more vulnerable to compromise through password
      theft or phishing attacks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the IAM Dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - Step 4: Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Step 4: Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Step 5: Under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Manage'.
    - Step 6: Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
