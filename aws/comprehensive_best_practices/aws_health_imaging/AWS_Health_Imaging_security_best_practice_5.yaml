    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps to safeguard sensitive
      data and meet compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is recommended to protect
      sensitive data stored in the cloud. Without encryption, data is vulnerable to
      unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and non-compliance with
      regulatory standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled and configured with the appropriate
      encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Enable "Default encryption" and choose the desired encryption method (e.g.,
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes.
