    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access, posing a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are private
      by default helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify the
      ACL settings of each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
