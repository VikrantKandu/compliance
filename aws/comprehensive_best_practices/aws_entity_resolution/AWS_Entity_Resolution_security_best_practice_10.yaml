    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Bucket Policies
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have bucket policies configured
      to control access and permissions. Bucket policies provide fine-grained access
      control to AWS resources, ensuring that data stored in S3 is protected against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Configuring bucket policies is crucial for securing data in S3. Without
      proper policies, sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized users, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check if there is a bucket policy configured.
    - Verify that the bucket policy follows the principle of least privilege.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have no bucket policies configured, allowing
      open access unless explicitly restricted.
    Remediation:
    - Identify S3 buckets without bucket policies.
    - Define and apply bucket policies that restrict access to only authorized users
      and services.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure they meet security requirements.
