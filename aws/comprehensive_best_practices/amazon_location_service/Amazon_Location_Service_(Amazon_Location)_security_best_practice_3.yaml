    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      increasing the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.
      Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and verify the ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and block public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
