    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Approved AMIs are those that have been vetted
      for security and compliance with organizational policies.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and non-compliance
      issues, as they may not include necessary security patches or configurations.
      Approved AMIs help maintain a consistent security baseline across all instances.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Review the AMI ID for each running instance.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches those listed in the organization's approved
      AMI list.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI by default.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Terminate or re-provision these instances using an approved AMI.
    - Update launch templates or configurations to only allow the use of approved
      AMIs going forward.
