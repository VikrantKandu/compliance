    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched from approved Amazon Machine
      Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, security, and compliance across your
      AWS environment.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that all EC2 instances adhere to organizational
      security policies and configurations. Unapproved AMIs may have vulnerabilities
      or configurations that do not align with security best practices, potentially
      leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. List all running EC2 instances. 4. Verify the AMI ID used for each instance
      against the list of approved AMIs maintained by your organization. 5. Ensure
      all instances are using an approved AMI.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      for launching EC2 instances.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances using unapproved AMIs. 2. Create a snapshot
      of the current instance for backup purposes. 3. Terminate the instance if it
      is using an unapproved AMI. 4. Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
      5. Restore data and configurations from the snapshot if necessary.
