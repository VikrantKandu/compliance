    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access
      to AWS resources, which significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial because it enhances security
      by requiring additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, accounts
      are vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, potentially
      leading to data breaches or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify that MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically verify MFA
      status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard
      and select 'Users'. 3. Choose the specific user for whom you want to enable
      MFA. 4. In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA'. 5. Follow the
      prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
