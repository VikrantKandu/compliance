    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review each bucket's permissions and ensure that there are no public access
      permissions. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL for public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Modify the bucket permissions
      to remove public access. 5. Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific
      users or roles. 6. Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
