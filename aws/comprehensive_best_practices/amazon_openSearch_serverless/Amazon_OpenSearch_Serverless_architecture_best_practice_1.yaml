  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. This may lead to data leakage, compliance violations, and reputational
      damage. Ensuring buckets are private protects data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the Amazon S3 console.
      3. Select the bucket you want to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions and
      bucket policy to ensure that there are no public access permissions. 5. Use
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL
      settings. 6. Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 console and select the bucket. 2. Review and
      modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions. 3.
      Enable block public access settings on the bucket. 4. Regularly audit bucket
      permissions to ensure compliance.
