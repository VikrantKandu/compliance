  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible protects sensitive information
      and complies with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that 'Block all public
      access' settings are enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public access policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket with public access. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Block
      public access'. 4. Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes. 5. Review
      bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
