    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. This check verifies that all S3 buckets have the
      "Block Public Access" setting enabled, which restricts public access to the
      buckets.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Click on "Block Public Access" and enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
