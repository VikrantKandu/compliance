    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before they can access
      sensitive resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access. If the root account credentials are compromised, MFA acts as an additional
      barrier, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the AWS account and its
      resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Verify that a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device is associated with the
      root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account and click on "Enable MFA."
    - Follow the instructions to configure a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Verify that MFA is successfully enabled and associated with the root account.
