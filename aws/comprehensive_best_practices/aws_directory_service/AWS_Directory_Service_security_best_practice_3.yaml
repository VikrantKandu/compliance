  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate pieces of evidence for authentication, reducing the risk
      of unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: MFA provides an additional layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. Without MFA, a compromised password could allow an attacker to
      gain full access to the AWS account, leading to potential data breaches, resource
      misuse, and financial loss.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and filter for the root account.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
    - Verify that MFA is successfully enabled by logging out and logging back in with
      the MFA device.
