    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private by default,
      meaning they are not publicly accessible.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this
      risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions to ensure that they are not set to allow
      public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket ACLs and confirm no public access is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly made public.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket permissions to remove any
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy and ACL
      settings to restrict access to authorized users only.
