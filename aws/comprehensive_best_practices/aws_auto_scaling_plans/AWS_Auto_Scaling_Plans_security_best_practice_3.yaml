    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security by requiring
      an additional verification step.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised passwords. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to attacks, which can lead to unauthorized data access and
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the list of IAM users and verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select each IAM user and click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA for the user.
    - Confirm that MFA is successfully enabled for each user.
