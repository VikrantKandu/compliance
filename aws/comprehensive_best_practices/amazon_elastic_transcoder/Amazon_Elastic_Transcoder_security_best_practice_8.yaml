    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, posing a significant security risk. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL)
      to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket permissions
      to block public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to ensure it does not permit public access.
    - Review and adjust the ACL to restrict access to authorized users only.
