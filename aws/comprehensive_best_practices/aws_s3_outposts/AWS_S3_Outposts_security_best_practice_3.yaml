    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide more than one form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enforcing MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker
      could gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA significantly reduces
      this risk by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select each user to verify
      if MFA is enabled. 5. Check the Security credentials tab for MFA device status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab and
      then Manage MFA device. 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA
      device for the user.
