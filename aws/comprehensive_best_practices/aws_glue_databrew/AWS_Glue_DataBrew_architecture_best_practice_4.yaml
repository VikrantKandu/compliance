    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant risk to data security and privacy. Ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive information and maintain compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
