    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access, which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and sensitive
      information leaks if not properly secured. Ensuring buckets are not public helps
      maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and ensure the ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
