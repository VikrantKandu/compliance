  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group as it allows unrestricted inbound access. Ensuring instances are not using
      the default security group helps to restrict unnecessary exposure to the internet.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to security vulnerabilities
      as it allows all inbound traffic by default. This increases the risk of unauthorized
      access and potential attacks on the instances.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Ensure no instances are using the default security
      group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with the required inbound and outbound rules. 3. Detach
      the default security group from the instance. 4. Attach the newly created security
      group to the instance.
