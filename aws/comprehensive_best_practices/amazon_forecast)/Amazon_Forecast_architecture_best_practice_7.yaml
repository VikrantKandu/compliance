    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Logging Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that logging is enabled on all S3 buckets to track
      access requests and actions. Enabling logging helps in auditing and monitoring
      access to the data stored in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Enabling logging on S3 buckets provides a way to monitor and audit
      access to the data, which is crucial for security and compliance. Without logging,
      unauthorized access or data breaches might go unnoticed, leading to potential
      data loss or exposure.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the 'Properties' tab. 4. Under 'Server access logging',
      check if logging is enabled. 5. Repeat for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have logging enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket for which you want to enable logging. 4. Go to the 'Properties'
      tab and find 'Server access logging'. 5. Enable logging and specify a target
      bucket for the logs. 6. Save the changes.
