    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but permissions can be modified
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For any bucket with public access, update the bucket policy to remove public
      access permissions.
    - Enable the Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust IAM policies that might grant unintended public access to
      the bucket.
