    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a password policy is enabled for AWS IAM
      users. A strong password policy helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of password-related
      security breaches, helping to protect sensitive AWS resources and data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that a password policy is enabled and configured according to your organization's
      standards.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Click on 'Set password policy'.
    - Configure the password policy settings as per your organization's security requirements.
    - Save the changes to enforce the password policy.
