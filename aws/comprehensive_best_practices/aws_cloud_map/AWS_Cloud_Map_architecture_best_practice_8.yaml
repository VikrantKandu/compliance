    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from being exposed to unauthorized users, reducing the risk of data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any settings that allow
      public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to the bucket to authorized users only.
