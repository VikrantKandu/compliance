    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and should
      be avoided unless explicitly required for public content distribution.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      unauthorized data access and data breaches. Public access can lead to exposure
      of sensitive information and potential misuse of data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and examine the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure that the options to block
      public access are enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Remove any statements in the bucket policy or ACLs that grant public access.
