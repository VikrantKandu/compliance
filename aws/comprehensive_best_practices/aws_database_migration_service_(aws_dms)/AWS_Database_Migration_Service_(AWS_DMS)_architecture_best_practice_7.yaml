    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Public exposure of data can lead to data breaches,
      compliance violations, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket to ensure that no bucket is publicly
      accessible.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and check for public access
      configurations.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Enable bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to buckets.
