    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound traffic. Using custom
      security groups helps in implementing the principle of least privilege.
    Rationale: Default security groups allow all inbound traffic, posing a security
      risk. By ensuring instances are not using default security groups, you reduce
      the attack surface and enhance the security posture of your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the 'Security Groups' column.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with the necessary rules.
    - Update the instance settings to associate them with the new security group.
    - Delete or modify the default security group to restrict its permissions if possible.
