    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles rather than directly
      to users. This practice helps manage permissions more efficiently and securely
      by grouping users with similar access requirements.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      management and increased risk of unauthorized access. By using groups or roles,
      permissions can be managed centrally, reducing the risk of misconfiguration
      and ensuring consistent access control.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM policies.
    - Verify that no policies are directly attached to individual users.
    - Ensure all policies are attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Identify IAM policies attached directly to users.
    - Detach these policies from users.
    - Create groups or roles with the necessary policies.
    - Add users to these groups or assign roles to users as needed.
