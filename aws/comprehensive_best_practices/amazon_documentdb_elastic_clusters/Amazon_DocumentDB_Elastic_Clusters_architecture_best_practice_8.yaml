    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring buckets are private protects against
      unauthorized data exposure and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions for each bucket to ensure that 'Block all public access'
      is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly modified.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access configurations.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
