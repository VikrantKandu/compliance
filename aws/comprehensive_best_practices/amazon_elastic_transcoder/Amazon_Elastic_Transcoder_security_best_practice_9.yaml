    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification step
      during login.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account adds an extra layer of security, making
      it more difficult for unauthorized users to access the account even if the password
      is compromised. Without MFA, the root account is more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, posing significant security risks.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. Check the "Security Credentials"
      tab for the root account. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: The root account does not have MFA enabled by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service and select the root account. 3. Go to the "Security Credentials" tab.
      4. Click on "Activate MFA" and follow the instructions to set up a virtual or
      hardware MFA device.
