    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by the organization to meet security and compliance
      requirements.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are built from a secure,
      hardened baseline, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance
      with organizational policies. Non-compliance can lead to security breaches and
      non-adherence to regulatory standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID against the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by the organization.
    - Verify that all instances are using approved AMIs.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI by default, including
      public and unapproved AMIs.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan for replacement or re-launch of these instances using an approved AMI.
    - Update policies and IAM roles to restrict the launch of instances to approved
      AMIs only.
