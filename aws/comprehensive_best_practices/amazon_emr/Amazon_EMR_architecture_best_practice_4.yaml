    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This reduces the risk of compromised accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If an IAM user's password is compromised, MFA can prevent
      unauthorized access by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" to view the list of IAM users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
