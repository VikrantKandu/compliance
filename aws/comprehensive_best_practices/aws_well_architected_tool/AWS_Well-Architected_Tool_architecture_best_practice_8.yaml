  - ID: AWS-001
  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users in the AWS account to enhance account security by requiring a second
      form of verification.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to the AWS account,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that 'Assigned MFA device'
      is set for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the
      on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
