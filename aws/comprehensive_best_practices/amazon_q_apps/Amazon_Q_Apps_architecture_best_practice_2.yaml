    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles instead of individual
      users to simplify management and enhance security.
    Rationale: Attaching policies to groups or roles reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by minimizing direct user policy attachments. It also simplifies policy
      management and auditing.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of IAM users and check for policies directly attached
        to individual users.
    - Step 4: Verify that policies are primarily attached to groups or roles.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify users with directly attached policies.
    - Step 2: Create groups or roles with the necessary policies.
    - Step 3: Attach users to these groups or assign roles to them.
    - Step 4: Remove direct policy attachments from individual users.
