    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      which poses a significant security risk. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and ensure they do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each non-compliant bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to remove any public access permissions.
