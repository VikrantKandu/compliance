    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      protects against unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Check for any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
