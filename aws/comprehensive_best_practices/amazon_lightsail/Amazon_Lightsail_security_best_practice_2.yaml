    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless
      explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access to only necessary users
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access permissions.
    - Verify that no buckets are set to be publicly accessible unless required for
      business purposes.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS Config to programmatically check bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDK to update bucket policies programmatically to restrict
      public access.
