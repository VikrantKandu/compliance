    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to the data stored within. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to maintaining data security
      and privacy. Public buckets can expose sensitive information, leading to data
      leaks and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible by checking the bucket policy and
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
