    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access permissions. Ensure that
      bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not grant public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>
      to check the ACL settings and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name>
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings at both the bucket and account levels
      to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with best
      practices.
