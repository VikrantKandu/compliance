    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and encrypted. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data stored
      in S3 from unauthorized access and ensuring data integrity.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible or unencrypted pose significant
      security risks, including data breaches and unauthorized data access. Ensuring
      buckets are private and encrypted mitigates these risks and complies with security
      best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab to ensure that public access is
      blocked.
    - Verify that the "Default encryption" is enabled under the "Properties" tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the
      ACL settings and aws s3api get-bucket-encryption to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private but not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - To make a bucket private, configure the bucket policy and ACLs to block public
      access.
    - Enable default encryption by navigating to the bucket's "Properties" tab and
      selecting "Default encryption." Choose the appropriate encryption method (e.g.,
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
