    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Using the default security group may allow unrestricted
      access to the instances, posing a security risk.
    Rationale: Default security groups often allow unrestricted inbound and outbound
      traffic. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
      Ensuring instances are associated with custom security groups allows for more
      granular control over network traffic.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security groups' column to verify that the associated
      security group is not the default.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws ec2 describe-instances' and check
      the security groups associated with each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may launch with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that meet
      your security requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with your EC2 instances by modifying the instance's
      settings in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI command 'aws ec2
      modify-instance-attribute'.
