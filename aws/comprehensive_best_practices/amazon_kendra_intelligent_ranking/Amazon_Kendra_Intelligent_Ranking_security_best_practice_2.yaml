    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting public access helps protect
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy or
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
