    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and pose a
      security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data and maintain compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions and bucket policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket access settings do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block public access settings and ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
