  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is stored within them.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality. Unauthorized access can result in data theft, compliance
      violations, and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and their access settings. 4. Ensure that the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use
      AWS CLI or AWS SDK to programmatically check bucket policies for public access
      permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation: 1. For any bucket found to be publicly accessible, review and modify
      the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access. 2. Use the AWS Management
      Console or AWS CLI to remove any public access permissions. 3. Enable S3 Block
      Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
