  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
      This check helps in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data
      stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of data leaks and ensures
      compliance with data protection regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACLs do not grant public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
