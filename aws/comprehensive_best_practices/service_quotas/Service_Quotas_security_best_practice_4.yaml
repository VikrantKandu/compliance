    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: "This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled\
      \ for all AWS IAM users. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user\u2019\
      s password, greatly enhancing account security."
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a crucial security measure that helps
      protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized actions and data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check if MFA is enabled
      by verifying the MFA device status. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>
      to programmatically verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users and select a user. 4. Under
      the Security credentials tab, choose Manage MFA device. 5. Follow the prompts
      to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
