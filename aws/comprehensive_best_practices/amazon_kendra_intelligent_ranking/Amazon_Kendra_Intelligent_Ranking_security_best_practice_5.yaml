    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized access
      to sensitive data, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block public access' settings and
      bucket policy.
    - Ensure that all public access is blocked and there are no bucket policies granting
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
