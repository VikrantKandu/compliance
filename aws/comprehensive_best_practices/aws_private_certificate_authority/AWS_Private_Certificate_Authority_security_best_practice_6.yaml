    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. This ensures that sensitive data is not exposed to the internet, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates
      the risk of sensitive data being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
