    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts are more
      susceptible to phishing attacks and credential theft, leading to potential data
      breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users."
    - Select each user and check if "MFA device" is assigned.
    - Verify that all users have an MFA device configured.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user to which you want to assign an MFA device.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click on "Manage" in the "Assigned MFA
      device" section.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
