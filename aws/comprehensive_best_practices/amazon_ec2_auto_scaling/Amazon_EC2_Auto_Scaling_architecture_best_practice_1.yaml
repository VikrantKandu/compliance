    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which is permissive and poses a security risk. Custom
      security groups should be used to restrict inbound and outbound traffic according
      to the principle of least privilege.
    Rationale: Using the default security group, which allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, can expose instances to unauthorized access and attacks. Custom security
      groups allow for tailored rules that enhance security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific rules that meet your security requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
