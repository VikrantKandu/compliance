    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring S3 buckets are private reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket's public access settings are disabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that
      grant public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block public access settings and ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket ACL to remove public access.
