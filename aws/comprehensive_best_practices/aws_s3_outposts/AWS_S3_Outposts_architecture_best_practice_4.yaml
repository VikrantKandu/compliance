    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. This can lead to data breaches,
      compliance violations, and unauthorized use of data.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab to see if the bucket has public
      access. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket ACL for public access permissions. 5. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check the bucket policy
      for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Review and edit the bucket
      policy and ACL to remove public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI to update bucket
      permissions and policies to restrict public access as needed.
