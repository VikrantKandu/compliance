    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to
      sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access permissions enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access using aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
