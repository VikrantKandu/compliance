    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets
        marked as 'Public'.
    - Step 4: For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its permissions.
    - Step 5: Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow
        public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
        policy and ACL to restrict access.
    - Action 2: Use the 'Block Public Access' settings in the S3 console to prevent
        any future public access configurations.
    - Action 3: Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
        best practices.
