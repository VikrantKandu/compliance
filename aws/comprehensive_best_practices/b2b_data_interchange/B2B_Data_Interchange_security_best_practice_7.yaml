    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure. It verifies that bucket policies and
      ACLs are configured to prevent public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private protects sensitive information
      and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure 'Block all public access'
      is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL to confirm that they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
