    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy Requires Strong Passwords
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that the IAM password policy requires strong passwords,
      including a minimum length and complexity requirements. Strong passwords help
      protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Strong passwords are essential to prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      resources. Weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked, leading to potential
      security breaches and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings".
    - Verify that the password policy is set to require at least:
      - One uppercase letter
      - One lowercase letter
      - One number
      - One non-alphanumeric character
      - Minimum password length of 8 characters
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce a strong password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings".
    - Click on "Manage password policy".
    - Set the password policy to require at least:
      - One uppercase letter
      - One lowercase letter
      - One number
      - One non-alphanumeric character
      - Minimum password length of 8 characters
    - Save the changes.
