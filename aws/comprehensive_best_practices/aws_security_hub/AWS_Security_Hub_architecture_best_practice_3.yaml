    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      can easily gain access to the account. MFA adds an extra layer of protection,
      making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
