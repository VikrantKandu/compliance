    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Unrestricted public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized data manipulation. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible,
      you reduce the risk of data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure that
      they do not allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to confirm that public access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL).
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
