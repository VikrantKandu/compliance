    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are not
      public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket allows public access.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not permit public access.
    - Use the AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify buckets with public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do
      not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      and bucket levels.
    - Regularly review and monitor bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
