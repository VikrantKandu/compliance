    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, potentially
      leading to data leaks or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps protect
      sensitive data and comply with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket's access control list (ACL) to ensure it is not set to public.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement access controls and bucket policies that restrict access to only authorized
      users and applications.
