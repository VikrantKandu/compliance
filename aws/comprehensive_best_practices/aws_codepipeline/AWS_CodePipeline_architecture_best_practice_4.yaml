    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound
      and outbound traffic, which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to potential
      threats due to its permissive nature. Restricting traffic with custom security
      groups helps in minimizing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the 'Security Groups' associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with a security group named 'default'.
    Default Value: By default, if no security group is specified, EC2 instances are
      associated with the default security group.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with restrictive inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the EC2 instances with the newly created security group by modifying
      the instance settings in the EC2 dashboard.
