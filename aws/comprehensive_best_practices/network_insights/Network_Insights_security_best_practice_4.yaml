    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within them. Public
      access to buckets should be carefully controlled and only granted when absolutely
      necessary.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of exposure and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket and ensure that 'Block all public access'
      is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with 'Block all public access'
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be secured.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Ensure the option 'Block all public access' is checked.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
