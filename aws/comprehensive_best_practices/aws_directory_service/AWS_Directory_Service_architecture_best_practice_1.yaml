    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA provides an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select each user and check if
      MFA is enabled under the "Security credentials" tab.
    Default Value: IAM users do not have MFA enabled by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. Under "Assigned
      MFA device", choose "Manage" and follow the prompts to assign an MFA device.
