    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and identify any with public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      check the access control list for public access.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by using the command
      'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Edit the bucket permissions to remove public access by disabling 'Block Public
      Access' settings.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to control access to the bucket.
