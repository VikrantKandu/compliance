    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to benefit from security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer versions. Ensuring instances use the latest AMIs reduces
      security risks and improves performance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left menu.
    - Check the AMI ID of each running instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the instance type.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI, depending
      on how they were launched.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Stop the instance.
    - Create an AMI from the instance if needed for backup.
    - Launch a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate any necessary data and configurations to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance once the new instance is verified operational.
