    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS
      account. If compromised, an attacker could potentially gain full control over
      the account. Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Dashboard'.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Dashboard'.
    - In the 'Security Status' section, choose 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
