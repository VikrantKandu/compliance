    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access, as it requires a second form of verification in addition to the password.
      If MFA is not enabled, there is a higher risk of account compromise.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Locate the root account and check
      if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your root account credentials.
      2. Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)', select 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the instructions to set up and enable
      MFA using a supported MFA device.
