    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring S3 buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the Amazon S3 console.
      3. Select the bucket you want to review. 4. Click on the Permissions tab. 5.
      Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 6. Check the Block
      Public Access settings and confirm that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Open the Amazon S3 console. 2. Select the bucket you need to modify.
      3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Edit the bucket policy to remove any statements
      that allow public access. 5. Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent
      future public access configurations.
