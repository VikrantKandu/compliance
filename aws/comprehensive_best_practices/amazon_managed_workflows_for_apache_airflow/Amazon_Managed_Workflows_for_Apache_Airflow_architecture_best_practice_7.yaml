    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail should be enabled in all AWS regions to ensure that all
      account activity is recorded. This helps in auditing and compliance, as well
      as in detecting any unauthorized activity.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that no activity goes unmonitored,
      which is crucial for security and compliance. Without this, unauthorized or
      malicious activities may go undetected, increasing the risk of data breaches
      and non-compliance with regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that there is at least one trail configured to log events in all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is logging management events, data events, and insights
      events if applicable.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Ensure the trail is configured to log all necessary event types.
    - Save the changes and verify that logs are being generated in all regions.
