    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to maintaining data
      security and privacy. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data loss, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to review the bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review the bucket policies
      for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public
      access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Review and update IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
