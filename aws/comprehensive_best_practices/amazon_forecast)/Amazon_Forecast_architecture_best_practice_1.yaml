    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to enhance
      security by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to your AWS accounts by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication. This reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access in case credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user without MFA enabled.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage' next to the 'Assigned
      MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and assign an MFA device to the user.
