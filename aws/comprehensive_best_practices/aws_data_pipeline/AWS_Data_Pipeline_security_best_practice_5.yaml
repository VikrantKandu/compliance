    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are encrypted to protect
      sensitive data at rest. Encryption helps to secure data by converting it into
      a format that is unreadable without the proper decryption key.
    Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data
      loss or theft.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify that default encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable default encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or S3-managed
      keys (SSE-S3).
    - Save the changes to ensure all new objects are encrypted by default.
