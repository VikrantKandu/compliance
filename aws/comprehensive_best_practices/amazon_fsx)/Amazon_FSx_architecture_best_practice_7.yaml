    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public exposure of S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
      Implementing this check helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      they do not grant public access.
