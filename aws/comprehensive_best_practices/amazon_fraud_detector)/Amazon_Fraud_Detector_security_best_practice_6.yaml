    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is disabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public permissions.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
