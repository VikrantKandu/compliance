    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps maintain the
      confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in S3.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
