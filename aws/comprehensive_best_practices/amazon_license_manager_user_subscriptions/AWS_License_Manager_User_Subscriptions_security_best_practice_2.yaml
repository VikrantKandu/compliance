    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have a public access setting enabled.
    - Check for any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket permissions to disable public access.
    - Update any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
