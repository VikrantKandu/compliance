    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      data loss, or data leakage. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates
      these risks and protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify buckets with a "Public" label.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access settings.
