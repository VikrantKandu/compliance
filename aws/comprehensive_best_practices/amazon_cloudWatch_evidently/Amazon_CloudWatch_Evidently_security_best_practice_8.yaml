  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. By default, S3 buckets should
      be private and access should be restricted to specific users or roles.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private with no public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
