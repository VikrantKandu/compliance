  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Public
      accessibility should be restricted unless explicitly required for specific use
      cases.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access, posing significant security risks. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Verify that the 'Block
      all public access' setting is enabled. 5. Check the bucket policy and access
      control list (ACL) to ensure they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that needs to be secured. 3. Enable 'Block all public access' for
      the bucket. 4. Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements
      that allow public access. 5. Modify the ACL to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
