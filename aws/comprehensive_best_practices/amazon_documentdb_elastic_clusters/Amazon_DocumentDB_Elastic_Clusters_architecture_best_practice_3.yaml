    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive data and comply
      with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and adjust as necessary to ensure compliance.
