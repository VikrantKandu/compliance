    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which is crucial for data protection and privacy. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users on the internet.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates the risk
      of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions granted.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, but permissions can be modified
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
