    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this risk by restricting
      access to only authorized users and services.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to check if public access is restricted.
    - Verify bucket policies do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify bucket policies and ACLs
      to restrict public access.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for all buckets.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
