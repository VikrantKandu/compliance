    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to inadvertent data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection
      standards.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the Amazon S3 console.
    - In the Buckets list, select the name of the bucket.
    - Choose the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that public access is restricted.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs to configure 'Block Public Access'
      settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Implement IAM policies that restrict access to authorized users only.
