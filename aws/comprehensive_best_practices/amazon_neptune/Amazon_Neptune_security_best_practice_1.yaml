  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved according to the organization's security and compliance
      standards.
  - Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are configured with the
      necessary security patches and configurations. Unapproved AMIs may contain vulnerabilities
      or non-compliant settings, posing a security risk.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running instances and identify the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches those on the organization's approved AMI list.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any available AMI.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify instances running on unapproved AMIs.
    - Create an AMI from an approved source if necessary.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instances and launch new instances using the approved
      AMI.
