    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Have Termination Protection Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that termination protection is enabled for all
      EC2 instances to prevent accidental termination.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection helps prevent accidental deletion of
      EC2 instances, which could lead to data loss or service disruption.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the instance details to ensure that Termination Protection
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id
      <instance-id> --attribute disableApiTermination to verify the setting.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is disabled for EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Select the instance you want to modify.
    - Click on the Actions dropdown, choose Instance Settings, and select Change Termination
      Protection.
    - Enable Termination Protection and save the changes.
