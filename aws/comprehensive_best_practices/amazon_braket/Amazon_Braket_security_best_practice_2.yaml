  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent data breaches
      and ensures that only authorized users can access the stored data. Publicly
      accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate
      data.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions settings for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow
        public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not accessible to the public.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 3: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Enable "Block all public access" to prevent unauthorized public access.
    - Step 5: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not permit
        public access.
