    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials and
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial because it mitigates the risk
      of credential theft and unauthorized access. Without MFA, attackers who gain
      access to a user's credentials can easily access AWS resources, potentially
      leading to data breaches and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
