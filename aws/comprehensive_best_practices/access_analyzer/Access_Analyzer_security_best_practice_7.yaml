    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to
      sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have any "Public Access" settings enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI:
      - Run `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>` and ensure no grants
        have "URI" set to "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers" or "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers".
    - Run `aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>` and ensure the policy
      does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions under "Block public access (bucket settings)".
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access:
      - Remove any statements that allow public access.
      - Ensure the policy includes a statement to deny public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL:
      - Run `aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private`.
      - Update the bucket policy using `aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        --policy file://policy.json` where `policy.json` denies public access.
