    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict access
      to only authorized users to maintain data security and compliance with privacy
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users.
