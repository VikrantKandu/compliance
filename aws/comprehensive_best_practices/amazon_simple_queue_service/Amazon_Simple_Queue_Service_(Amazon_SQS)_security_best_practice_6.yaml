    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound traffic. Using the
      default security group can expose instances to potential security threats.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound traffic from any source,
      which poses a significant security risk. Instances should be associated with
      custom security groups that have specific inbound and outbound rules to control
      traffic and minimize exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may use the default security group
      if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the instance.
    - Associate the instance with the newly created security group.
