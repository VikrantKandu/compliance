  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are within a VPC
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to enhance security and control over the network environment.
  - Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides network isolation and
      allows for more granular control over network traffic, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the navigation pane. 4. Verify that each instance
      is associated with a VPC by checking the 'VPC ID' column.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC if no
      specific VPC is selected.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances not associated with a VPC. 2. Stop the
      instances. 3. Create or select an appropriate VPC. 4. Launch new instances within
      the selected VPC. 5. Terminate the original instances not in a VPC.
