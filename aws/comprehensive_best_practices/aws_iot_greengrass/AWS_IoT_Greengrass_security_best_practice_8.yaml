    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
      Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions set in the bucket policy
      or ACL.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to list bucket policies and ACLs and verify that
      public access is not allowed.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
