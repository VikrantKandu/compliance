    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication
      in addition to their password. This best practice helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains
      a user's password can gain full access to their permissions, potentially leading
      to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to confirm that MFA devices are associated
      with each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," choose "Manage" and follow the instructions to
      assign an MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users.
