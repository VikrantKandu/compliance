    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that there are no public
      access settings enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket ACL for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting on the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
