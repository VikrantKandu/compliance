  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive
      information to the public.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that the bucket
      does not have public read or write permissions enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command
      'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to review the ACL settings.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to review the bucket policy for public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL. 2. Review
      and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
      3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
