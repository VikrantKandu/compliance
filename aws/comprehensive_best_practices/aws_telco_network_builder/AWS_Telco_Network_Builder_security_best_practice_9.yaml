    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public reduces the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any permissions that allow
      public access.
