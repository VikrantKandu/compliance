    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy or ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for all accounts and buckets.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure compliance with organizational
      security standards.
