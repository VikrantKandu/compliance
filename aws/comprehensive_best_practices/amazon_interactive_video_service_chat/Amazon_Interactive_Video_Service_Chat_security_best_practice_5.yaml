    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups often allow unrestricted inbound
      traffic, which can pose security risks.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risk as it typically allows inbound traffic from any source. Ensuring instances
      are associated with specific security groups allows for more granular control
      over network access.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, check the associated
      security groups. 5. Confirm that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if not specified otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Identify all EC2 instances using the default security group. 2.
      Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per
      your security requirements. 3. Detach the default security group from the instances.
      4. Attach the newly created security group to the instances.
