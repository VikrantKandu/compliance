    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block all public access' setting for each bucket.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
