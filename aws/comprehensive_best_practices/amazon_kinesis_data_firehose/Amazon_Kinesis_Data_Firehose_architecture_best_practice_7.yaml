    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are launched in a custom VPC
      rather than the default VPC. Custom VPCs provide enhanced security and control
      over network configurations.
    Rationale: Using a default VPC can lead to less secure network configurations
      and lack of control over network traffic. Custom VPCs allow for better segmentation,
      security group management, and network access control, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      'VPC ID' column. 5. Verify that the VPC ID is not the default VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched in the default VPC if
      no specific VPC is chosen.
    Remediation: 1. Identify the EC2 instances running in the default VPC. 2. Create
      a custom VPC with appropriate subnets, route tables, and security groups. 3.
      Stop the EC2 instance running in the default VPC. 4. Create an AMI of the instance.
      5. Launch a new EC2 instance in the custom VPC using the created AMI. 6. Terminate
      the original instance in the default VPC.
