    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can expose sensitive information to the internet, leading to potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data exposure and breaches. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect sensitive data and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Verify that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Check the bucket's Access Control List
      (ACL) to ensure it is not set to public.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket to modify. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Review and
      update the bucket policy to remove public access permissions. 5. Adjust the
      bucket's ACL settings to restrict access to only authorized users.
