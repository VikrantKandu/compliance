    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect sensitive information and comply with data
      protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access policies or ACLs attached to the buckets.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and check for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access policies or ACLs.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent future public access settings.
