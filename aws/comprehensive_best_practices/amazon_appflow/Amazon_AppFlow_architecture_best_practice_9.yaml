    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to confirm the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings from
      being applied to buckets and objects.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions and adjust as necessary to maintain security
      compliance.
