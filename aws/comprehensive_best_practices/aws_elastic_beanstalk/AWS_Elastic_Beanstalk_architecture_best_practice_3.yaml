    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have a policy allowing public access or that
      the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
