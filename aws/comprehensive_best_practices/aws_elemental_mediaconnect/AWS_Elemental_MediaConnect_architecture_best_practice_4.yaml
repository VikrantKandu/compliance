    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is unintentionally exposed. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are
      enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDK to automate the remediation process if necessary.
