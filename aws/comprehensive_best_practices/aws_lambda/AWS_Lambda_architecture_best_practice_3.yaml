    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Regularly monitor buckets for any changes in access permissions.
