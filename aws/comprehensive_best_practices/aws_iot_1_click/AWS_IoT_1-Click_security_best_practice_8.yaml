    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all newly created S3 buckets are private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Private S3 buckets protect data from unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches. By ensuring buckets are private by default, organizations reduce
      the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab and ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
        the ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the bucket policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may vary
      based on user settings.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Review and modify bucket ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to set the bucket to private.
    - Enable AWS Config rules to monitor bucket permissions continuously.
