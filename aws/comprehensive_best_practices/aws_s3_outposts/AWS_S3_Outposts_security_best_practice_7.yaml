    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security to your AWS environments by requiring
      an additional form of authentication. This ensures that even if a password is
      compromised, unauthorized access is still prevented.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS resources. Without MFA, attackers who obtain a user's password
      could gain full access to AWS services and data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
