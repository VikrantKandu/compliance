    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data exposure in case of
      unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive information stored in S3
      could be accessed by malicious actors, leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Default encryption" setting in the "Properties"
      tab.
    - Ensure that each bucket has server-side encryption enabled, either with Amazon
      S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have default encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption".
    - Choose either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS)
      for encryption.
