    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all AWS IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If a user's credentials are compromised, MFA provides an additional
      barrier that an attacker would need to bypass, reducing the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select Users.
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled. This can be done by selecting a
      user and checking the Security credentials tab for MFA device status.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user who needs MFA enabled.
    - Go to the Security credentials tab and choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the steps to assign and enable an MFA device for the user.
