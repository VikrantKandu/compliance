    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are private by default to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless
      explicitly required and justified.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches or unintended data exposure. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default reduces the risk of accidental public exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default when created.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs to be made private. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Enable the "Block all public access" setting. 6. Review and modify the
      bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
