    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to data exposure. It is important to restrict public access
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leakage. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and enable "Block public access" settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
