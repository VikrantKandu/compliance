    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing
      a significant security risk if sensitive data is stored.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
