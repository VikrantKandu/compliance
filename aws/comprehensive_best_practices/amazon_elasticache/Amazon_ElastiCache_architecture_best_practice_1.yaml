    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data leaks,
      loss of sensitive information, and potential financial and reputational damage
      to the organization.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
      Specifically, check the 'Block all public access' setting for each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket permissions and identify
      any buckets with public access policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and edit the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
