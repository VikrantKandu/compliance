    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA helps protect
      user accounts by requiring a second form of authentication in addition to the
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing or password guessing.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled by confirming the presence of
      an MFA device in the "Security credentials" tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - For each user, go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA" and follow the instructions to assign and enable an MFA
      device.
