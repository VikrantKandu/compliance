  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches
      if sensitive data is stored.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Review bucket policies to ensure they do not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the access requirements.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' from the S3 console.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide necessary access to
      specific users or roles.
