    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account adds an extra layer of security,
      making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.
      Without MFA, the root account is vulnerable to compromise, which can lead to
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section and locate the root account.
    - Check the "Security Credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the "My Security Credentials" page.
    - Select "Activate MFA" and follow the on-screen instructions to set up a virtual
      MFA device.
    - Confirm the setup by entering the authentication codes provided by the MFA device.
