  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are launched within a VPC
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
      to ensure network isolation and control over network configurations.
  - Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides enhanced security features
      such as network isolation, customizable network configurations, and improved
      control over inbound and outbound traffic. Not using a VPC can expose instances
      to unnecessary security risks and limit network configuration options.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - Step 4: Verify that the 'VPC ID' column is populated for all instances.
    - Step 5: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and
        check for the presence of 'VpcId' in the output for each instance.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC if no
      specific VPC is chosen.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances not launched in a VPC.
    - Step 2: Plan to migrate these instances to a VPC by creating AMIs and launching
        new instances within a VPC.
    - Step 3: Update any associated resources such as security groups, elastic IPs,
        and route tables to accommodate the new VPC configuration.
