    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, leading to potential data
      breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are private helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity, and prevents
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to verify that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
