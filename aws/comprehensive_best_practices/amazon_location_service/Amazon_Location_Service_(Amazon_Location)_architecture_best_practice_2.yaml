    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption ensures that
      the data stored in S3 is automatically encrypted and decrypted when accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial for protecting
      sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data at rest is
      vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access, leading to potential data loss
      or exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Check the "Default encryption" section to verify if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and find the "Default encryption" section.
    - Enable server-side encryption by choosing an encryption method, such as AWS-KMS
      or AES-256.
    - Save the changes to ensure encryption is applied to all new objects stored in
      the bucket.
