    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets are
      private, but misconfigurations can lead to unintended public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket permissions and confirm public access
      is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or access control lists that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK to update bucket permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
