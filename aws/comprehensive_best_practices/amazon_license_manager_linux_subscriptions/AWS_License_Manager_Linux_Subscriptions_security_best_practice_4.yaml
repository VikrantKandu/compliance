    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unintentional
      data exposure.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket policies do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to modify the bucket policy and remove
      any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS IAM policies to enforce stricter access controls.
