    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an
      extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances the security of AWS
      accounts by requiring additional authentication factors, making it more difficult
      for unauthorized users to access sensitive resources. Without MFA, the risk
      of account compromise increases, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      changes to infrastructure.
    Audit: Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list all IAM users and verify
      that MFA is enabled for each user. Specifically, execute the command aws iam
      list-users to retrieve all users and then aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
      <username> to check MFA devices associated with each user. Ensure that each
      user has at least one MFA device enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: If any IAM user does not have MFA enabled, access the AWS Management
      Console, navigate to the IAM service, select the user, and add an MFA device.
      Follow the on-screen instructions to configure either a virtual MFA device or
      a hardware MFA device for the user.
