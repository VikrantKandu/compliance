    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance
      the security of AWS accounts. MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain full
      access to the account. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring an additional
      authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the 'Users' section for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify that each user has an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users.'
    - For each user, select 'Security credentials' and assign an MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA, which typically involves scanning
      a QR code with an MFA app or receiving a hardware MFA device.
