    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps
      protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have block public access settings enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" for the bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access permissions securely.
