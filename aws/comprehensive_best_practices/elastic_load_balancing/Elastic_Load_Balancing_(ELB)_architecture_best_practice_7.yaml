    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data breaches and maintains data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs.
    - Confirm that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
