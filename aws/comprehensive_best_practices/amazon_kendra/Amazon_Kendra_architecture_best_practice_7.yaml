    Title: Ensure Security Groups are configured with least privilege
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Security groups should be configured to allow only the minimum necessary
      access to resources. This includes restricting inbound and outbound traffic
      to only what is required for the application to function.
    Rationale: Overly permissive security group rules can expose resources to unnecessary
      risk, including unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Configuring
      security groups with least privilege reduces the attack surface and helps protect
      against malicious activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Security Groups" from the navigation pane.
    - Review each security group for overly permissive rules, such as wide IP ranges
      or open ports.
    - Ensure that the rules are specific to the application's needs.
    Default Value: Security groups are created with no inbound rules and allow all
      outbound traffic by default.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the specific access requirements for your application.
    - Modify security group rules to allow only the necessary inbound and outbound
      traffic.
    - Remove any rules that are not explicitly required for the application to function.
