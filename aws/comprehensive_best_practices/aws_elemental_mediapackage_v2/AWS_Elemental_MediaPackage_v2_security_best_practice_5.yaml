    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and pose security
      risks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches by exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm there are no
      public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
