    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. This check helps maintain data privacy and
      security by restricting access to only authorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature to enforce restrictions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to secure.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to block all public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
    - Save changes to enforce the new settings.
