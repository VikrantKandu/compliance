    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      private reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or specific buckets.
