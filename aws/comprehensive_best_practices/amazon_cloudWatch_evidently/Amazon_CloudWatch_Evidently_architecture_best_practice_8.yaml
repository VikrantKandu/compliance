  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data
      exposure.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to unauthorized users, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
      Restricting public access minimizes the risk of data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings for
      each bucket. 4. Ensure that no bucket allows public access by checking the Block
      Public Access settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket with public access. 3. Go to the Permissions tab and click
      on Block Public Access. 4. Ensure all settings to block public access are enabled
      and save the changes. 5. Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
