    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to review ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and remove any public access settings in the bucket
      policy or ACL.
    - Consider enabling "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
