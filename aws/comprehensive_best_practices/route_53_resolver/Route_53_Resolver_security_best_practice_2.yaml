    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption. Encryption protects data at rest and helps prevent unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data exposure in the event
      of unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in S3 buckets
      could be vulnerable to breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the 'Default encryption' setting.
    - Ensure that the 'Default encryption' is set to either 'AES-256' or 'AWS-KMS'.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not encrypted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Default encryption', select 'Enable'.
    - Choose 'AES-256' or 'AWS-KMS' for encryption.
    - Save the changes.
