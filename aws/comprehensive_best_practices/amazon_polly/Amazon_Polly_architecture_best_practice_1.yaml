    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security by requiring additional verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of user accounts by requiring additional
      verification, which helps prevent unauthorized access even if a password is
      compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - Click on each user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
