    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using IAM roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using IAM roles to
      manage permissions. IAM roles provide a secure way to grant permissions to applications
      running on EC2 instances without the need for access keys.
    Rationale: Using IAM roles for EC2 instances enhances security by eliminating
      the need to store AWS access keys on the instances. It reduces the risk of credentials
      being compromised and ensures that permissions can be managed centrally and
      dynamically.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select each instance and verify that an IAM role is associated with it.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the IamInstanceProfile field for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are not associated with any IAM role.
    Remediation:
    - Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions.
    - Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance either through the AWS Management Console
      or using the AWS CLI.
    - Ensure that the instance profile is correctly configured to assume the role.
