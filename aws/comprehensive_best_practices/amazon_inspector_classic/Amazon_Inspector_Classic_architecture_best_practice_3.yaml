    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces the risk of account compromise by
      requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      that all users have MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - Click on each user to view their security credentials.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the prompts to enable MFA for each user.
