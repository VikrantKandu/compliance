    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not public helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions".
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
