    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their access policies.
    - Verify that each bucket's permissions are set to private and do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check bucket permissions.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to ensure no public access is allowed.
