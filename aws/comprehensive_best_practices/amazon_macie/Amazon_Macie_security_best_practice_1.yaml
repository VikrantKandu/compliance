    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra layer of security for user sign-in,
      reducing the risk of compromised credentials being used to access AWS resources.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA enabled' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to select a device and configure MFA for the user.
