    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional authentication
      factors beyond just a username and password. This helps protect against unauthorized
      access to your AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, attackers who gain
      access to user passwords can easily access your AWS resources, potentially leading
      to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Ensure that all users have a 'MFA device' configured.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Under the 'Security Credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device to
      the user.
    - Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled.
