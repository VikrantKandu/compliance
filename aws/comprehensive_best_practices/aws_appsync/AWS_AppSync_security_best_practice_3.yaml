    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized entities. Public access can be
      inadvertently granted through bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leakage. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACL is not granting public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy.
    - Update the bucket ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
