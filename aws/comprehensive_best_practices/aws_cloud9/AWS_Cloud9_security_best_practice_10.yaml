    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access and data breaches. S3 buckets should be configured
      to deny public access unless explicitly required and justified.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure,
      unauthorized data manipulation, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data leaks and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public
      access is granted.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access configurations.
    - Save the changes and verify that public access is denied.
