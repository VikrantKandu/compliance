    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure. Without
      MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to compromise through phishing attacks
      or credential theft. MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      by requiring an additional verification step.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify if "MFA Device" is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" under the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
