    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data theft, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
      Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket to ensure they are
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
