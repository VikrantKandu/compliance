    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are launched using the latest
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to security
      vulnerabilities and lack of updates.
    Rationale: Using the latest AMIs ensures that instances have the most up-to-date
      security patches and features. Outdated AMIs can lead to potential security
      risks and system vulnerabilities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID being used.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest AMI ID available in the AWS Marketplace or
      your custom AMI repository.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMIs unless
      specifically configured.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance to complete the remediation process.
