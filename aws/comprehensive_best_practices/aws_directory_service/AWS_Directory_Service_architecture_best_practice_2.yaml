    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to only
      authorized users mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm there are
      no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and configure 'Block public access' settings to block
      all public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
