    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an additional
      layer of protection on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the account. MFA requires users to provide a second form
      of verification, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized individuals
      to access the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA
      for the user.
