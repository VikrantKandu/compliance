    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible. S3 buckets should have restricted access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring S3 buckets are private protects sensitive data
      and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets in your account.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that no public access
      is granted.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings in the S3 console to prevent public access.
    - Review and update bucket ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
