    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential exposure of sensitive data. Restricting access to only
      authorized users and applications minimizes the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions settings.
    - Ensure no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs programmatically.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access granted via bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      and bucket levels.
    - Regularly review and update bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
