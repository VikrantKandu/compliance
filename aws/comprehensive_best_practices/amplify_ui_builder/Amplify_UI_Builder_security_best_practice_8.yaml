  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., an MFA device.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances security by providing
      an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. Without MFA,
      a compromised password could allow an attacker to access AWS resources.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for the "MFA device" column.
      Ensure that all users have an MFA device assigned.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
