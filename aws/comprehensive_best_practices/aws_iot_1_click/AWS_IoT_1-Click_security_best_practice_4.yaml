    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data exfiltration. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no buckets have public access enabled. This includes checking bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      any public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future configurations from
      making the bucket public.
