    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. By ensuring buckets are not public, you mitigate the risk of
      data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI to run the command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>
        to check the ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI to run the command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name>
        to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure that only authorized users have access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to all buckets
      in the account.
