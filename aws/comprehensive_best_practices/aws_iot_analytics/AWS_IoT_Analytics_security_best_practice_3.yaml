    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an extra layer
      of security to AWS accounts. MFA requires users to provide a second form of
      authentication, enhancing the protection against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are stolen,
      an attacker could gain full access to the user's permissions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user for the presence of an MFA device under the Security credentials
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        for each user to verify MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, click on Manage for Assigned MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
