    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to sensitive data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a security risk.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket from the S3 console.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to specific users or roles.
