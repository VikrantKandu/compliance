    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      data access, data leaks, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to review.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket settings to
      block public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket in the S3 console.
