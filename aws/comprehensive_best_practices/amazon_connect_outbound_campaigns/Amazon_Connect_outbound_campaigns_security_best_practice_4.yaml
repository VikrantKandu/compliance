    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon
      Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches and features.
      Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have been addressed
      in newer versions.
    Rationale: Regularly updating AMIs helps protect instances from known vulnerabilities
      and exploits. By ensuring that instances use the latest AMIs, organizations
      can reduce the risk of security breaches and maintain compliance with security
      standards.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select Instances and review the AMI ID used by each instance.
    - Step 4: Compare the AMI ID with the latest version available in the AMI catalog.
    - Step 5: Verify that all instances are using the latest AMI version.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with outdated AMIs if not regularly updated.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Action 2: Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Action 3: Migrate data and configurations to the new instance.
    - Action 4: Terminate the old instance once the new instance is verified to be
        fully operational.
