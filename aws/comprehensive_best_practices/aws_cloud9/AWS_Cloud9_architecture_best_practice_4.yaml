    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. Public access should be restricted
      to prevent sensitive data from being accessible to the internet.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that all options are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify any existing bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access
      permissions.
