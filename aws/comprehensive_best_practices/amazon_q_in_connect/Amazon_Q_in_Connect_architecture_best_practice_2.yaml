  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, security, and compliance
      across the infrastructure.
  - Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities, inconsistencies,
      and compliance issues. Approved AMIs are vetted for security and compliance,
      ensuring that instances are provisioned with the necessary configurations and
      patches.
  - Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID of each instance against the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by your organization.
    - Ensure that all instances are using AMIs from the approved list.
  - Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan and execute a migration strategy to transition these instances to approved
      AMIs.
    - Update policies and automation scripts to enforce the use of approved AMIs for
      future instance launches.
