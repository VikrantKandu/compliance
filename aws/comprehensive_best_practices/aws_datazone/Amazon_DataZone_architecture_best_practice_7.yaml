  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access. MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of identification beyond their password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials and reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised passwords
      could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial loss.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user and check the
      'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use
      the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to list users without
      MFA enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and select
      'Manage MFA device'. 6. Follow the prompts to enable and configure the MFA device
      for the user.
