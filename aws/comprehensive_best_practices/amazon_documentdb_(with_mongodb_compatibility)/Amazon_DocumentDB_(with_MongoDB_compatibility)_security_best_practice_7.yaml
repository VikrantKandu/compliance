    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      to prevent data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Restricting access helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to edit bucket permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict
      public access.
