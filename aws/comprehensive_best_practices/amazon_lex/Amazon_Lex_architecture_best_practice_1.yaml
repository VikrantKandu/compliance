    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks, unauthorized access, and data breaches. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of exposing sensitive
      data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Confirm that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if it is not already enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
