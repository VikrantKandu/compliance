    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches or unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
      service. 3. Select a bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Check the
      'Block public access' settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify that the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the Amazon S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly
      accessible. 3. Click on the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
      4. Review the bucket policy and ACL, and remove any statements that allow public
      access.
