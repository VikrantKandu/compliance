    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      to prevent data leaks and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions to ensure that there are no public access permissions
      set.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and ensure no policies allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible when created.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions.
    - Update bucket policies to restrict access to only authorized users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access settings.
