    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the public
      internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket's access control list (ACL) to confirm that it is not granting
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket's ACL to remove any public access grants.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent accidental public exposure.
