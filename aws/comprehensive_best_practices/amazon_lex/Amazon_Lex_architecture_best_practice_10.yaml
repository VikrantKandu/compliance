    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection on top
      of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      in the event a user's credentials are compromised. Without MFA, there is a higher
      risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA Device' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Under 'Security credentials', select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
