    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Do Not Have Public IP Addresses
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: EC2 instances should not have public IP addresses to reduce exposure
      to the internet and potential attacks. Instances should be placed in private
      subnets and accessed through secure methods such as VPNs or bastion hosts.
    Rationale: Assigning public IP addresses to EC2 instances increases the attack
      surface, potentially exposing them to unauthorized access and threats. Limiting
      public IP addresses helps in maintaining a secure environment and reduces the
      risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the Instances section.
    - Review the list of instances and check the Public IP column.
    - Verify that no instances have a public IP address assigned.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with or without public
      IP addresses, depending on the subnet settings.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances with public IP addresses.
    - Modify the subnet settings to disable automatic public IP assignment.
    - For existing instances, disassociate the public IP address or move the instance
      to a private subnet.
    - Implement secure access methods such as a VPN or bastion host to connect to
      the instance.
