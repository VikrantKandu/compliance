    ID: AWS-IAM-001
    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      password policies are enabled and configured according to security best practices.
      A strong password policy helps protect against unauthorized access by enforcing
      complexity requirements.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      user accounts by making it more difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force
      passwords. Without a strong password policy, accounts are vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions within your
      AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Verify that a password policy is configured and that it includes the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters
      - Require at least one uppercase letter
      - Require at least one lowercase letter
      - Require at least one number
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character
      - Password expiration and reuse prevention settings
    Default Value: By default, AWS accounts do not have a password policy enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Click on the Set password policy button.
    - Configure the password policy to include complexity requirements such as a minimum
      length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
    - Save the changes to enforce the password policy.
