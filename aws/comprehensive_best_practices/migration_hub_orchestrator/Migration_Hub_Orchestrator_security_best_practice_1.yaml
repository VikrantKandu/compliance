    Title: Enable Versioning on S3 Buckets
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that versioning is enabled on all S3 buckets to protect against
      accidental or malicious data deletion or modification. Versioning allows you
      to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket, providing a way to
      recover from unintended overwrites and deletions.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets is critical for data protection and
      recovery. Without versioning, any accidental or intentional deletion or modification
      of data could lead to permanent data loss, which could have serious business
      or compliance implications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and choose the "Properties" tab.
    - Check if the "Versioning" status is "Enabled".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket
        <bucket-name> to verify the versioning status.
    Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default on new S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket where you want to enable versioning.
    - Choose the "Properties" tab and click on "Edit" in the Versioning section.
    - Select "Enable" and save the changes.
    - Confirm the changes by checking the "Versioning" status in the bucket properties.
