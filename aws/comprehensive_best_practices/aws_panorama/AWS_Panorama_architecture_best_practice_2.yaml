    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication
      factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users provides an extra layer of security by requiring
      not only a password but also a second authentication factor. This reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources if a password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled. This can be verified by checking
      the "MFA" column in the user list or by selecting a user and reviewing the "Security
      credentials" tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - Choose a user for whom MFA needs to be enabled.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA device" and follow the steps to assign an MFA device to
      the user.
