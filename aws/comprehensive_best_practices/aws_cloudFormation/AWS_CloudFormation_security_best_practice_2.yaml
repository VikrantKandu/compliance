  - Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: The IAM password policy should be enabled to enforce strong password
      requirements for all IAM users. This ensures that passwords meet complexity
      requirements, are rotated regularly, and are not reused.
  - Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access due to weak or compromised passwords. Without a password policy, users
      may set easily guessable passwords, increasing the likelihood of security breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity
      and Access Management) service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings."
      4. Verify that the password policy is set and includes requirements such as
      minimum length, expiration, and complexity.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce a password policy.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Account settings." 4. Set a password
      policy by configuring requirements for password length, expiration, and complexity.
      5. Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
