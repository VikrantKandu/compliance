  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, an attacker who
      gains access to a user's password could potentially access sensitive data and
      resources.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7.
      Follow the prompts to assign and activate the MFA device.
