    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive data. Public buckets pose a security risk, potentially
      exposing sensitive information to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to confirm the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access.
