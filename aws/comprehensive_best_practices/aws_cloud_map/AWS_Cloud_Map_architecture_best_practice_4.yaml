    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that are approved by the organization. Using approved AMIs helps maintain a
      consistent and secure environment.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities and inconsistencies
      in the environment. Approved AMIs are vetted for security and compliance, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized or malicious software.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify that the AMI ID for each instance matches the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any available AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any EC2 instances running with unapproved AMIs.
    - Replace or terminate instances using unapproved AMIs and relaunch them with
      approved AMIs.
    - Update organizational policies to enforce the use of approved AMIs.
