    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Restricting public access helps protect data
      integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as Public.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the Permissions tab, and verify
      that the Block all public access setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable the Block all public access setting.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
