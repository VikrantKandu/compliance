    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA provides an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches or other security
      incidents.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Review each user to verify that
      MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
      to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Click on the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In
      the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow
      the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
