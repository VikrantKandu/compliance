    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive information to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to programmatically check the bucket policies
      and ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with private access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, modify the bucket policy to remove public
      access permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the bucket
      level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
