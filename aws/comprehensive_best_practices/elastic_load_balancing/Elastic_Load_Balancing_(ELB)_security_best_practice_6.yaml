    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) that are approved by the organization. Using approved
      AMIs helps maintain consistent security configurations and compliance requirements
      across all instances.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can lead to security vulnerabilities, inconsistent
      configurations, and potential compliance violations. Approved AMIs are vetted
      for security and compliance, ensuring they meet organizational standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by the
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any public or private
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Replace the unapproved AMI by creating a new instance with an approved AMI.
    - Terminate the instance using the unapproved AMI after successful migration.
