    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of accidental data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Access' column for each S3 bucket to check if any are marked as
      public.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket's policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and access is restricted to
      the bucket owner.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, remove any public access permissions from
      the bucket's ACL and bucket policy.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to apply a bucket policy that denies
      public access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access
      is granted to the bucket.
