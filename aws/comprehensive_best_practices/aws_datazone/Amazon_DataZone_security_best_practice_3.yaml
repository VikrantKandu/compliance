  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access unless
      explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and
      unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data loss or leakage.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
