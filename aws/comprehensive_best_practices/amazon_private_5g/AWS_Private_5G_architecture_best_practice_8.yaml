    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to incorporate the latest security patches
      and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs may expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer versions. Keeping AMIs updated reduces the attack surface
      and ensures compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Review the AMI ID of each running instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI in the AWS Marketplace or your
      custom AMIs.
    - Verify that the running instances are using the latest AMI.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with any AMI, including outdated ones.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Prepare the latest AMI with necessary configurations.
    - Plan and execute a migration of workloads to new instances using the latest
      AMI.
    - Terminate instances running on outdated AMIs after successful migration.
