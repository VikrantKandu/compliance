    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches or data leakage.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL)
      settings.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions set.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove public ACLs or policies if necessary.
