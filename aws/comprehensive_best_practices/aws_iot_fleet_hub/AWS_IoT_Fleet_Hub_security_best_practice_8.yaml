    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by attackers to access
      sensitive data. Ensuring they are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Step 4: Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Step 5: Review the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Step 6: Verify the Access Control List (ACL) to ensure it is not granting public
        access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Step 2: Remove any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Step 3: Adjust the ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Step 4: Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
