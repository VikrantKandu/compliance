  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance issues. Limiting access to
      only authorized users reduces the risk of data leaks.
  - Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and identify any with public access enabled.
    - Check the bucket permissions and policies for 'Everyone' or 'Any authenticated
      AWS user' access.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check for bucket policies allowing public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Adjust bucket ACLs to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
