    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing sensitive
      information to the internet. This check helps maintain data privacy and security
      by preventing inadvertent public access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
