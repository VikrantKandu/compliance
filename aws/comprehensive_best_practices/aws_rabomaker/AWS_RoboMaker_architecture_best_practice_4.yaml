    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access,
      which prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps maintain
      data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check ACL settings.
    - Use the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket policy or access control list
      (ACL).
    - Enable block public access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
