    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps secure access
      to the AWS Management Console and AWS API endpoints.
    Rationale: Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data breaches, financial loss, and
      reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
