  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound traffic. This check ensures that instances
      are using security groups with defined rules to control inbound and outbound
      traffic.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to the EC2 instances, potentially exposing them to unauthorized
      access and attacks. Custom security groups should be used to enforce least privilege
      and limit access to necessary ports and IP ranges.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, check the associated
      security groups. 5. Verify that none of the instances are using the default
      security group.
  - Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances might be associated with the default
      security group, which allows all inbound traffic.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules. 3. Attach the
      new security group to the instances. 4. Remove the default security group from
      the instances.
