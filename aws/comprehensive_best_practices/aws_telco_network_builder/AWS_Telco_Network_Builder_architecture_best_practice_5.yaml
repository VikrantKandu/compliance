    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name and navigate to the "Permissions"
      tab.
    - Verify that the "Block public access" settings are enabled and that there are
      no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      compliance.
