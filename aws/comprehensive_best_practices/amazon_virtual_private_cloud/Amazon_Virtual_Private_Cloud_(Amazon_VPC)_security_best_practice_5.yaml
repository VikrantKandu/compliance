    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles Instead of Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are attached to groups or roles
      rather than directly to users. This best practice promotes better management
      and scalability of permissions by using groups or roles to manage access.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      management and potential security risks if user access needs to be revoked or
      modified. Using groups or roles makes it easier to manage permissions consistently
      and reduces the risk of human error.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Permissions tab to verify that no policies are directly
      attached.
    - Instead, ensure that permissions are granted through group memberships or role
      assignments.
    Default Value: IAM policies are often attached directly to users in smaller or
      less mature environments.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies directly attached to users.
    - Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles.
    - Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles.
    - Add users to the appropriate groups or assign them the necessary roles to ensure
      they have the required permissions.
