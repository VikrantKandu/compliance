    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to AWS accounts by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access, potentially resulting in data breaches or misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA enabled' column to ensure it is set to 'Yes'.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
