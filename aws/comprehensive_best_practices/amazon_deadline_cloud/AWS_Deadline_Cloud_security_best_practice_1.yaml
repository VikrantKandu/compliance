    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon
      Machine Image (AMI) to ensure they have the latest updates and security patches.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose your EC2 instances to vulnerabilities
      and security risks. Ensuring that instances are launched with the latest AMI
      helps maintain security and stability.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Compare the AMI IDs with the latest AMIs available in the AWS Marketplace or
      your custom AMIs.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with older AMIs if not regularly updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances with outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new AMI from the latest available version.
    - Stop the instance and create a snapshot of the root volume.
    - Launch a new instance using the latest AMI and attach any necessary volumes.
    - Verify the new instance is functioning correctly and terminate the old instance
      if no longer needed.
