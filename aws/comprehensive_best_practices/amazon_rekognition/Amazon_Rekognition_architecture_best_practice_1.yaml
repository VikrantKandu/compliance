    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring that buckets are
      private by default helps mitigate these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command "aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>"
      to verify ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command "aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>"
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to configure the bucket to block all
      public access.
    - Implement IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
