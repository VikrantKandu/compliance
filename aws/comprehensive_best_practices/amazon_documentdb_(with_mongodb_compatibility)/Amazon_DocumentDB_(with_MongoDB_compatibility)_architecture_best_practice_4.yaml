    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to confidential
      data, resulting in potential data leaks and compliance violations. Restricting
      public access helps maintain data security and privacy.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Check the "Block Public Access" settings
      to confirm that all public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Update the bucket policy to remove
      any statements that allow public access. 4. Enable "Block Public Access" settings
      for the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
