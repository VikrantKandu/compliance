    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide two
      or more verification factors to gain access, which significantly reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access by requiring additional verification beyond just a password. This is
      crucial for preventing potential security breaches and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user to enable MFA for and go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section and follow
      the instructions to assign an MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for all users without MFA enabled.
