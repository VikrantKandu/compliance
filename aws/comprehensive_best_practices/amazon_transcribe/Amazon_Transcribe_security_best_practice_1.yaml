    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      in the event that a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of account compromise by
      requiring additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, if a
      password is compromised, an unauthorized user could gain full access to the
      AWS account and its resources, leading to potential data breaches or misuse
      of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA for the user.
