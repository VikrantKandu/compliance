    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. This practice reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it permits
      unrestricted access to instances. By ensuring instances use custom security
      groups with specific rules, you can enforce a principle of least privilege and
      better protect resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Ensure that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your requirements.
    - Detach the default security group and attach the newly created security group
      to the affected instances.
