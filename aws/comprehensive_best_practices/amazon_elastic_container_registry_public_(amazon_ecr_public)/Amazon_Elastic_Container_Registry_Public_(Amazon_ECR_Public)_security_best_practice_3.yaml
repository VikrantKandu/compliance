    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of data breaches and helps maintain compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL and ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets and objects are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies or ACLs to restrict public access,
      if necessary.
