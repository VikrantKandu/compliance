    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure that all public access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and click on 'Block public access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access and save the changes.
