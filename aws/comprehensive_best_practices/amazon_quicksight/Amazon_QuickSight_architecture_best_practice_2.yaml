    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default.
      It verifies that bucket policies do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required and justified.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket ACLs.
    - Confirm that the bucket does not have a public-read or public-read-write permission.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Identify buckets that are publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
