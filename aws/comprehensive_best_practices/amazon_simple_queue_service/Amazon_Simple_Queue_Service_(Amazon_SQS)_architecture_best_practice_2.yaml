    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible mitigates the risk of unintended data disclosure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket's ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket's policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Consider using bucket policies or IAM roles to restrict access to only authorized
      users.
