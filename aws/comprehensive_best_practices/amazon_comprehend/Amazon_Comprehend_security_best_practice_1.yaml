    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to authorized
      users and applications minimizes security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting to prevent future public access.
