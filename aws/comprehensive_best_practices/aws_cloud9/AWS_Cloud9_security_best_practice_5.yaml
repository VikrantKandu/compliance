    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of identification
      beyond their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access even if
      a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's
      password can fully control the user's permissions and resources, leading to
      potential data breaches and unauthorized activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to programmatically
      list users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure MFA for the user.
