    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access and that the Block
      Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Access the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
