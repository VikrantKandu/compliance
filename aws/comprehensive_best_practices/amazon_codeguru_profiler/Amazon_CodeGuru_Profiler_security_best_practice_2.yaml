    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is important to restrict
      public access to S3 buckets to protect data from being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By restricting public access, organizations
      can mitigate the risk of data exposure and comply with security and privacy
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all
      public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to further
      restrict access to the bucket.
