    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that an IAM password policy is enabled to enforce
      strong password requirements for AWS IAM users. A password policy helps to enhance
      security by enforcing minimum password strength and rotation requirements.
    Rationale: Enabling a password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      by ensuring that IAM users adhere to strong password practices. Without a password
      policy, users may set weak passwords that are easily compromised, leading to
      potential security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Under the 'Account settings', check the 'Password policy' section.
    - Verify that a password policy is in place with requirements for minimum password
      length, complexity, and expiration.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Under 'Account settings', click 'Set password policy'.
    - Configure the password policy to enforce minimum length, complexity, and expiration
      requirements.
    - Save the changes to enable the password policy.
