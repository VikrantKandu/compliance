    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. It is crucial to restrict
      public access to prevent data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      resulting in potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the public access setting is disabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDKs to programmatically check bucket policies and access control
      lists (ACLs) for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public
      access.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings from being
      applied.
