  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of critical information.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data
      breaches by ensuring that only authorized users can access the data. Publicly
      accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to gain access to sensitive
      information.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Verify the bucket
      policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Open the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab
      and enable "Block all public access." 5. Review and modify the bucket policy
      and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
