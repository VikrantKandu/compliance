  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that S3 buckets do not have public read or write permissions.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are private
      by default reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket does
      not have "Everyone" or "Any authenticated AWS user" in the "Access Control List"
      with read or write permissions. 5. Check the "Bucket Policy" to ensure it does
      not allow public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to programmatically verify permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove public
      access by updating the bucket ACL and bucket policy. 2. Use the AWS Management
      Console to navigate to the bucket permissions and modify the ACL to remove public
      access. 3. Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users
      or roles. 4. Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access for the account or specific
      buckets to prevent public access configurations.
