    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
      It is crucial to restrict access to S3 buckets to only trusted users and applications.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. This can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and potential
      financial and reputational damage. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure that all options are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the ACL to remove any public access grants.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
