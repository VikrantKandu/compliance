  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches or unauthorized data access.
  - Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers to gain access
      to confidential information, leading to potential data leaks and compliance
      violations.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
      console. 3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that the
      bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket ACL does not
      grant public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure the bucket policy status is not public.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon
      S3 console. 3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Review and
      modify the bucket policy to restrict public access. 5. Remove any public access
      granted through the bucket ACL. 6. Enable block public access settings for the
      bucket to prevent future public access.
