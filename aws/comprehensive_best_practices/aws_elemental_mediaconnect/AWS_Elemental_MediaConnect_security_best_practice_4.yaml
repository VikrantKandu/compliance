    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. It is a security best practice to enable
      MFA for all IAM users to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials and reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could
      lead to data breaches and unauthorized activities.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
      to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
