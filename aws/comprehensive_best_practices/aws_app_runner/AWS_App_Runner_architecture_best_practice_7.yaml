    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and
      Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top
      of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. If a user's credentials are compromised, MFA can prevent attackers
      from gaining access without the additional authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select 'Manage MFA' under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
