    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      to leak data or incur unexpected costs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and block public access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled unless public access
      is necessary and justified.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Click on 'Permissions'.
    - Under 'Block public access', click 'Edit'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' unless there is a specific requirement for
      public access.
    - Save changes.
