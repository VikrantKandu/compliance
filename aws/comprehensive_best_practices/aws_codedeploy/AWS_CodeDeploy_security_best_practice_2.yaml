    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive data,
      which may result in data breaches or unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and security breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance
      with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block all public access' setting to ensure it is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
