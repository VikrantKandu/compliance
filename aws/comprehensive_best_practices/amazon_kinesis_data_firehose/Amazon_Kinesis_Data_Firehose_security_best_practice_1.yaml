    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to the data stored in them. Making S3 buckets
      public can expose sensitive data and lead to security breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of accidental data exposure
      and helps maintain data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that there are no public bucket policies or access control lists
        (ACLs) allowing public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket with public access.
    - Step 4: Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Step 5: Remove any public bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
