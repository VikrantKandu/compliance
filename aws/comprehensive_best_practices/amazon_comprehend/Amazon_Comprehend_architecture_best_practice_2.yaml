    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to provide
      an additional layer of security for accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker can
      gain access to the account. MFA requires a second form of verification, making
      it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to access AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Select "Manage" under the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
