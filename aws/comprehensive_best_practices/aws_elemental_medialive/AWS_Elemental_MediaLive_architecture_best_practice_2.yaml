    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFront Distributions Use HTTPS
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFront distributions are configured
      to use HTTPS for secure communication between clients and the distribution.
    Rationale: Using HTTPS ensures that data in transit is encrypted, protecting it
      from interception and tampering. Not using HTTPS can expose sensitive data to
      security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront console.
    - Select each distribution and review the settings under the "General" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Viewer Protocol Policy" is set to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS"
      or "HTTPS Only" for each distribution.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFront distributions may allow both HTTP and HTTPS
      traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront console.
    - Select the distribution to be modified.
    - Under the "General" tab, edit the "Viewer Protocol Policy" to "Redirect HTTP
      to HTTPS" or "HTTPS Only".
    - Save the changes to enforce HTTPS communication.
