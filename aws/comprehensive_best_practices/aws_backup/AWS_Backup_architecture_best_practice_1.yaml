    Title: Enable MFA for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts by requiring an additional
      layer of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password. This
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in cases where passwords
      are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", click "Manage" and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Confirm that MFA is enabled by checking the "MFA" column for the user.
