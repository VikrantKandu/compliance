    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access, as it requires an additional authentication factor beyond just a password.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and password theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        verify the MFA status for users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
