  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using only
      approved Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using approved AMIs helps maintain security
      and compliance by ensuring that instances are built from a known and trusted
      baseline.
  - Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities, outdated software,
      or misconfigurations into your environment. Approved AMIs are typically vetted
      for security and compliance, reducing the risk of exposure to potential threats.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. List all running EC2 instances. 4. Check the AMI ID for each instance against
      the list of approved AMI IDs. 5. Verify that all instances are using AMIs from
      the approved list.
  - Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify any EC2 instances not using approved AMIs. 2. Create
      a snapshot of the current instance state if necessary. 3. Terminate the non-compliant
      instance. 4. Launch a new instance using an approved AMI. 5. Restore data and
      configurations from the snapshot if applicable.
