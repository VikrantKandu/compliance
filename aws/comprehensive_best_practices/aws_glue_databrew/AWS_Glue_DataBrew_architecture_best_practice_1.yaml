    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can be inadvertently
      granted due to misconfigured bucket policies or ACLs.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      private by default helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their access permissions.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the bucket policy
      and ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
        bucket ACL.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
        the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure that it does not grant public access.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to restrict public access at
      the account or bucket level.
    - Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
