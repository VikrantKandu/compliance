    Title: Ensure EC2 instances have termination protection enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that termination protection is enabled for all
      EC2 instances to prevent accidental deletion. Termination protection helps safeguard
      critical instances from being inadvertently terminated, ensuring continuity
      and stability of services.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection on EC2 instances minimizes the risk
      of accidental termination, which can lead to service disruption, data loss,
      and potential financial impact. It is especially crucial for instances running
      critical workloads or hosting sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Termination Protection' status in the instance
      details.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute
      --instance-id <instance-id> --attribute disableApiTermination' to verify if
      termination protection is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is disabled for EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Choose the instance for which you want to enable termination protection.
    - Click on 'Actions', select 'Instance Settings', then 'Change Termination Protection'.
    - Enable termination protection and save changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id
      <instance-id> --no-disable-api-termination' to enable termination protection.
