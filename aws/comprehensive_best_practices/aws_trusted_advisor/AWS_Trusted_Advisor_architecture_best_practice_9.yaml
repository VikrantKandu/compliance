    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure, data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command "aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>" to
      verify ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command "aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>"
      to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Update the bucket ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future unintentional public
      access.
