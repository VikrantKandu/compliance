    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data exposure. By restricting public access, you mitigate the risk of data breaches
      and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 4. Verify that no bucket policies or access
      control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Under the "Permissions" tab, ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
      4. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
