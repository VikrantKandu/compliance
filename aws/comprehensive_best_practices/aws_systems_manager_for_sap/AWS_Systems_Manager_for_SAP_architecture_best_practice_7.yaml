    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive information to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACL settings that grant public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to control access
      to the bucket.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging to track access and changes.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access
      at the account level.
