    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound traffic
      from instances within the same security group and all outbound traffic, which
      may not align with the principle of least privilege.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to excessive permissions,
      increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Custom
      security groups should be created to enforce specific access controls tailored
      to the application's needs.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that adhere
      to the principle of least privilege.
    - Associate the new security group with the affected EC2 instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
