    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly enhances security by
      requiring additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, the root
      account is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to severe security
      breaches and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA on the root account. Ensure that it is enabled and configured
      correctly.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console using the root account.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', select 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure MFA using a supported MFA device.
