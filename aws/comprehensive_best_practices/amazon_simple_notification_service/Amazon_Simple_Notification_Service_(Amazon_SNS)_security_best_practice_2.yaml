    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data access,
      modification, or deletion, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not accessible to the public.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACLs
      to remove public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
