    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket settings to
      block all public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
