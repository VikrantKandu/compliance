    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure,
      resulting in data breaches or data leakage. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with
      data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Check the "Access" column for each bucket to ensure it does not indicate "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and
      verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Block public access".
    - Enable the option "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
