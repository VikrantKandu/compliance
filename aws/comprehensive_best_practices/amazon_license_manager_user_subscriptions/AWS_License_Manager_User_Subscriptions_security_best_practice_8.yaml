    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the public internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict public access to
      prevent data exposure and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets. 4. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions
      and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Verify that bucket
      policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Click on 'Permissions'
      and enable 'Block all public access.' 5. Review and update bucket policies and
      ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
