    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in potential data loss, privacy breaches, and non-compliance
      with data protection regulations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the public access
      settings do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket policies and ensure they do not grant
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy and public access settings.
    - Disable any public access settings and update the bucket policy to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
