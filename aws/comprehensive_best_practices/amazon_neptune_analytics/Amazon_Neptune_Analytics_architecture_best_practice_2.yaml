    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of exposure of sensitive information.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs). 4. Check the
      bucket policy for any public access settings. 5. Use the AWS CLI command 'aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to verify bucket ACLs. 6. Use the
      AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>' to check
      the bucket policy. 7. Ensure that the bucket does not have any public access
      configurations.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access from the bucket policy and ACLs. 2. Use
      the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access. 3. Regularly review
      bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance. 4. Implement IAM policies
      to restrict access to specific users or roles.
