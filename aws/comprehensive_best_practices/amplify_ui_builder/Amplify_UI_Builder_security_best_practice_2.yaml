    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data loss or unauthorized access. Restricting access to only trusted
      entities reduces the risk of data breaches.
    Audit: Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list all S3 buckets and check
      their access policies. Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy or ACL to restrict access. Consider using bucket policies to explicitly
      deny public access or enable bucket settings that block public access.
