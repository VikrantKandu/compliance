    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of the username and password, requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the AWS root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access. If the root account credentials are compromised, MFA can prevent an
      attacker from gaining access to the account without the second form of authentication.
      Failure to enable MFA increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      if 'AccountMFAEnabled' is set to '1'.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Complete the setup by verifying the MFA device with the generated codes.
