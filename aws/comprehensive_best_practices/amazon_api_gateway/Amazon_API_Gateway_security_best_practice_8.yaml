    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive
      information and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      or ACL does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent accidental
      public exposure.
