    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab to verify that public access is
      restricted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket's policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Disable any public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control
      access.
