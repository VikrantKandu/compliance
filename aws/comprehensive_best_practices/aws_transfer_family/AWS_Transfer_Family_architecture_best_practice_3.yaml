    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring a second form of authentication, which helps protect
      user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts by adding an additional layer of security. Without MFA, if a user's
      password is compromised, an attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions
      in AWS. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data loss, or unintended
      resource modifications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that 'Assigned MFA device' is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and go to the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA.
