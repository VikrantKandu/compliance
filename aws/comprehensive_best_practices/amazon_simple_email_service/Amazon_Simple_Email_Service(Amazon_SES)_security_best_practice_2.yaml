    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not use the default security group to ensure
      that only necessary traffic is allowed. Default security groups allow all inbound
      and outbound traffic, which can expose instances to unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to EC2 instances. Limiting access to only necessary ports
      and IP addresses reduces the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Security Groups from the left navigation pane.
    - Identify any instances associated with the default security group.
    - Verify that the security group rules are not overly permissive.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your application's needs.
    - Reassign the EC2 instances to the newly created security group.
    - Ensure that the default security group is not associated with any EC2 instances.
