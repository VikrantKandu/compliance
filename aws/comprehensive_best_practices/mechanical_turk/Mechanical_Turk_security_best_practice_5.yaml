    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Using a custom security
      group with specific rules enhances security by limiting access.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose your instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it permits all inbound and outbound traffic. Custom security groups
      allow you to define specific rules that restrict access, reducing the attack
      surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group, which allows all traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Assign the custom security group to your EC2 instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
