  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and potential security incidents. Ensuring that
      buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - For each bucket, verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL configuration.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Re-evaluate the need for any public access and apply least privilege principles.
