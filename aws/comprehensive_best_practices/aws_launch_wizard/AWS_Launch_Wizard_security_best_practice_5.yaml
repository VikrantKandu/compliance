    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      increasing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Public Access' column. 4. For each
      bucket, verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACLs and ensure no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Under 'Block public
      access', ensure 'Block all public access' is checked. 5. Save changes to apply
      the new settings.
