    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to be private, ensuring
      that no sensitive data is exposed publicly. This involves verifying that the
      bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policies do not allow public access and that the bucket
      ACLs are set to private.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are set to private, but configurations can
      be changed to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy to restrict access.
    - Modify the bucket ACLs to ensure they do not grant public read or write permissions.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
