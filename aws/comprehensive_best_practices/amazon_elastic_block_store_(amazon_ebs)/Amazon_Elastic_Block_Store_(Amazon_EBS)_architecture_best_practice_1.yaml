  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to protect
      sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone on the
      internet, potentially leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the "Block Public
      Access" settings to ensure all options are enabled. 5. Review the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public permissions are granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have block public access settings enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the S3 bucket. 2. Review
      and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions. 3. Update
      the ACL to ensure no public access is granted. 4. Regularly review bucket permissions
      to maintain compliance.
