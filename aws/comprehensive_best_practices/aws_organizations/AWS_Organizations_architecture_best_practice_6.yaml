    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce the
      risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches, which can result
      in sensitive information being exposed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and check if any bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' to programmatically verify the
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy' to check for any bucket policies
      allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket permissions to
      restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets.
