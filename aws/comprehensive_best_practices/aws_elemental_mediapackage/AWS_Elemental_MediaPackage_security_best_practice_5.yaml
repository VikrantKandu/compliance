    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication factor
      beyond a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring users
      to present a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access in case of compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Step 4: Select each user to check if MFA is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that MFA is enabled for all users by checking the "Security credentials"
        tab for the "Assigned MFA device" field.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Step 3: In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Step 4: Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Step 5: Choose the "Security credentials" tab and click on "Manage" under "MFA
        device".
    - Step 6: Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
