  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches. It is crucial to ensure that S3 buckets are configured to restrict
      public access unless explicitly required.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data leaks and unauthorized access, which can have significant
      security and compliance implications.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Check the bucket policy
      and ACLs to ensure there are no public access permissions. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Remove
      any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs. 5. Enable "Block
      all public access" settings for the bucket. 6. Save changes to apply the new
      settings.
