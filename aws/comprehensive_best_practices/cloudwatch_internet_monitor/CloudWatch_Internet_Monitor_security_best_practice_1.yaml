    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that no EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group. Using the default security group allows unrestricted inbound traffic,
      which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can expose instances to potential attacks. Ensuring that instances are
      associated with custom security groups helps to enforce least privilege access
      and enhance security.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      "Security groups" column to verify that the instance is not using the default
      security group. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances
      and check the security group IDs for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group unless
      specified otherwise during instance creation.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances associated with the default security group.
      2. Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules according
      to your security requirements. 3. Detach the default security group from the
      instance. 4. Attach the newly created security group to the instance.
