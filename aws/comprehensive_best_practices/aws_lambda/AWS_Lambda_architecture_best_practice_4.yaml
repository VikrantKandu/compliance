    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      users accessing sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data
      to the internet, leading to potential data leaks and regulatory non-compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
