    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the ACL of each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review the bucket policy
      for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the permissions tab.
    - Block all public access settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove
      any public access permissions.
