    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to exposure of sensitive data and potential security incidents.
    Rationale: By restricting public access to S3 buckets, you significantly reduce
      the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential security vulnerabilities.
      Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access,
      modify, or delete sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access (e.g., deny 'Principal'
      as '*').
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Remove any ACLs that allow public access.
