    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound and outbound access
      by default. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unwanted traffic
      and potential attacks, as it allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default.
      Ensuring instances are associated with custom security groups with specific
      rules helps minimize security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security Groups' column to ensure it is not associated
      with the default security group.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the security groups of each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified during creation.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances currently using the default
      security group.
    - Remove the default security group association from the instances.
