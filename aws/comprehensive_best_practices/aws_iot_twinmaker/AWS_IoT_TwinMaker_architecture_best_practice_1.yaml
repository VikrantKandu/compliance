    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access to add an extra layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user credentials by requiring
      an additional authentication factor beyond just a password. This reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access in the event of a compromised password.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select each user to review the Security credentials tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user with console access.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the
      user.
