    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible. This is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates
      this risk and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and check the Access column to ensure it does not
      show "Public". 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the Permissions
      tab. 5. Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the S3 console.
      2. Select the bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 3. Remove any public access
      settings in the bucket policy and ACL. 4. Enable "Block all public access" settings
      for the bucket. 5. Review and update IAM policies to ensure they do not grant
      public access.
