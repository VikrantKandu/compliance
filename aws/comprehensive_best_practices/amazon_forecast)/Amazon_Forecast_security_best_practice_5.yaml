    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to the AWS environment. MFA requires
      users to provide a second form of verification, such as a code from a mobile
      device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect access to AWS resources by
      requiring a second form of authentication. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage" and follow the prompts
      to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
