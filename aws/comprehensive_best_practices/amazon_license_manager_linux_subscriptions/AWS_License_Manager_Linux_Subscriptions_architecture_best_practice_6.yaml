    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default minimizes the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket's access is set to private and does not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly made public.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and go to the permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
