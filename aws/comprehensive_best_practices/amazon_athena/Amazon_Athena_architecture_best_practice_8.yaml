    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are not public
      is crucial for maintaining data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for each bucket to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy and ACL
      to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update the bucket policies and settings to ensure compliance.
