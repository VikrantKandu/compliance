    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can expose
      data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data and maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public" access status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions in the bucket permissions and
      bucket policy.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket ACL and policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
