    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an additional layer of security to the AWS account. MFA requires
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access, which significantly
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that mitigates
      the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a
      user's credentials could gain full access to the AWS account, potentially leading
      to data breaches or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users.'
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).'
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
