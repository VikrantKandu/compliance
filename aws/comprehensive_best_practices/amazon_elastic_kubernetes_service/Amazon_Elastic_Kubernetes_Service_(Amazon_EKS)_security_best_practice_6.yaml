    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should have appropriate
      access controls and policies to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as unauthorized
      users can access sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps
      protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Under the "Permissions" tab, enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
