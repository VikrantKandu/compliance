    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      data access, and potential breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps maintain data security and compliance with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket's permissions
      to block public access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
