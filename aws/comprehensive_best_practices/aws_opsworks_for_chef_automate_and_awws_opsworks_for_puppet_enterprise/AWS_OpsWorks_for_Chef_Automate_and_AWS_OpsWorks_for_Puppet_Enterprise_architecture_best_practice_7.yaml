    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access. Look for policies that grant "Everyone" or "Any authenticated AWS user"
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings in the S3 console to ensure no public
      access is allowed.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with the organization's
      security policies.
