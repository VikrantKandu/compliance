    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environments by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial to prevent unauthorized access,
      especially in case of compromised passwords. It mitigates the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized actions in the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by viewing the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click on 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
