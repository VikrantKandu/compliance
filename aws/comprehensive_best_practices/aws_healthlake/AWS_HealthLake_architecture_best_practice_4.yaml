    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional layer of authentication
      beyond just a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra layer of security for IAM user accounts,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access in case of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks, which can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized actions within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically check for MFA devices associated with each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", select "Manage".
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
