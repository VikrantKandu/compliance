    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to ensure
      data is not exposed to unauthorized users. S3 buckets should be configured to
      deny public access unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes the
      risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access settings.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
