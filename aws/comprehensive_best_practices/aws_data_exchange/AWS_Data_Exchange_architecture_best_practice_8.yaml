    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if credentials
      are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
