  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources by adding
      an additional layer of security. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Users". 4. For each user, check if
      MFA is enabled under the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Ensure that MFA is enabled
      for all IAM users.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Users". 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
      6. Under "Assigned MFA device", click "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
