    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within them.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to the internet, leading to data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private minimizes the risk of unauthorized access
      and data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can be easily discovered and exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Public access settings" to ensure that "Block
      all public access" is enabled. 4. Verify that no bucket policies or Access Control
      Lists (ACLs) allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check the ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs
      that grant public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policies and
      ACLs to restrict public access.
