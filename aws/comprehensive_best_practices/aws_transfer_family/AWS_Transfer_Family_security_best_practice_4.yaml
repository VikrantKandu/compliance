    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps protect data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm there are
      no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to grant access to specific users or roles as needed.
