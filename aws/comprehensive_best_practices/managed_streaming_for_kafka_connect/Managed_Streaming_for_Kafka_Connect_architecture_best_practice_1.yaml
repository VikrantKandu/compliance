    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict bucket
      access to only necessary users and services to maintain data security and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to block new public access settings.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
