    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption ensures that
      data stored in S3 is encrypted automatically, providing an additional layer
      of security.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
      access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to breaches and
      unauthorized access, which could lead to data exposure and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the properties to see if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab and click on 'Default encryption'.
    - Choose the desired encryption option (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) and save changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
      to enable encryption.
