    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using IAM Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should be configured to use IAM roles instead of embedding
      credentials within the instance. This enhances security by allowing secure and
      controlled access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Using IAM roles for EC2 instances eliminates the need to store AWS
      credentials on the instances, reducing the risk of credential leakage and unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the "IAM Role" column to verify that an IAM role is
      assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the "IamInstanceProfile" field for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have IAM roles assigned.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances without IAM roles.
    - Create or identify an appropriate IAM role with the necessary permissions.
    - Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instances either through the AWS Management Console,
      AWS CLI, or SDKs.
    - Ensure that applications running on the EC2 instances use the IAM role for accessing
      AWS resources.
