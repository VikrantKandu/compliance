    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings from
      being applied to the buckets.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with organizational
      security policies.
