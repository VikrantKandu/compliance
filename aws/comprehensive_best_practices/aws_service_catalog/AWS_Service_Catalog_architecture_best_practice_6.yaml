    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound traffic from other instances
      within the same security group, which can lead to unintended access.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks by allowing unrestricted inbound traffic. This can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound rules tailored to your
      application's needs.
    - Associate the custom security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Ensure that the default security group is not used by any EC2 instances.
