    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized public access. Keeping S3 buckets private is
      crucial to protect sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive
      information to the public internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to verify that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket ACL settings programmatically.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      policy attached to each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to adjust the bucket ACL and block
      public access settings.
    - Implement AWS IAM policies that restrict access to only authorized users and
      roles.
