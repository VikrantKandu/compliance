    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS
      IAM users to enhance security by enforcing password complexity and expiration.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy helps protect against unauthorized
      access by ensuring that passwords are complex and changed regularly. Without
      a strong password policy, accounts are more vulnerable to brute force attacks
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and meets the organization's security
      requirements, including minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
    Default Value: By default, AWS IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Choose "Set password policy."
    - Configure the password policy to meet security standards, including minimum
      length, complexity, and expiration settings.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
