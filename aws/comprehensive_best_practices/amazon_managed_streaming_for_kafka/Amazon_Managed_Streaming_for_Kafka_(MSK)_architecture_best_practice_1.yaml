- rule:
  - ID: AWS-IAM-01
  - Title: Ensure IAM users have MFA enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance security by requiring an additional layer of authentication.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      by requiring a second factor of authentication, which significantly increases
      account security. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users." 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to programmatically
      verify MFA status for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users." 4. Click on the user name
      for which you want to enable MFA. 5. Under the "Security credentials" tab, click
      "Manage MFA." 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for
      the user.
