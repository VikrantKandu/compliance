    Title: Ensure CloudFormation Stacks Have Termination Protection Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks have termination
      protection enabled to prevent accidental deletions. Termination protection is
      a feature that helps to safeguard critical stacks from being deleted unintentionally.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection on CloudFormation stacks helps prevent
      accidental deletions, which can lead to data loss and service disruption. This
      is especially important for stacks managing critical infrastructure or sensitive
      data.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select a stack and check the stack details. 4. Verify that termination
      protection is enabled for the stack. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws cloudformation describe-stacks and check the EnableTerminationProtection
      attribute for each stack.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is disabled for CloudFormation
      stacks.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select the stack for which you want to enable termination protection.
      4. Click on the "Actions" dropdown and select "Enable termination protection."
      5. Confirm the action to enable termination protection. 6. Alternatively, use
      the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation update-termination-protection --enable-termination-protection
      --stack-name <stack-name> to enable it programmatically.
