    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access, which can lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      review bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      public access.
