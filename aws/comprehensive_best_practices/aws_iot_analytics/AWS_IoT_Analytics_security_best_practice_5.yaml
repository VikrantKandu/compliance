    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps secure AWS
      accounts by requiring additional authentication factors.
    Rationale: Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access,
      which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized AWS resource usage. MFA significantly
      reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the specific user to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
