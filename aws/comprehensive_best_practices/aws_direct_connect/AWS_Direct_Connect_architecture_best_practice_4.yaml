    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access helps maintain data privacy
      and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled unless necessary.
    - Use AWS CLI with aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the business need for
      public access.
    - If public access is not required, modify the bucket policy or ACL settings to
      restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings and
      remove public access permissions.
