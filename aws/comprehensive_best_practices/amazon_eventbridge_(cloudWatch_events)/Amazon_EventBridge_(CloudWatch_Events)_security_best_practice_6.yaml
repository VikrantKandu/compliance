    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for AWS accounts by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain full
      access to the account. MFA requires an additional authentication factor, making
      it significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. For each user, check the "Security
      credentials" tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Go to the "Security credentials" tab. 6. Click "Manage"
      next to "Assigned MFA device". 7. Follow the prompts to enable and configure
      MFA for the user.
