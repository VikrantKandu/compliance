    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they may expose sensitive data to unauthorized individuals. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
