    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access to ensure
      data security and prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access to sensitive information, and potential data loss. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps maintain data integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check bucket ACLs for public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block Public Access".
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Save changes to update the bucket settings.
