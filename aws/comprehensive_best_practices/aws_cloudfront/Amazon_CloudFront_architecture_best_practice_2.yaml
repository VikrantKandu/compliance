    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk, as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data leaks,
      unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs)
      to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not have public access enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACLs.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
