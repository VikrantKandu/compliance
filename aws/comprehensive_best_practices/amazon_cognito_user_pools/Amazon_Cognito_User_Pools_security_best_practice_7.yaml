    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required
      for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
