    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you protect sensitive
      data from being exposed to the internet. Public access can lead to data leaks,
      compliance violations, and unauthorized access to your data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
