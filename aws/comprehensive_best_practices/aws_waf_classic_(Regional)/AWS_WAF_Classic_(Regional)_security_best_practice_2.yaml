  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private reduces
      the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Verify that there
      are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
  - Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access permissions.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the Permissions tab
      and enable "Block public access" settings. 5. Review and remove any bucket policies
      or ACLs that grant public access.
