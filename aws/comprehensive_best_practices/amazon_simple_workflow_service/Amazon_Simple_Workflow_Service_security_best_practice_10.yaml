    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enforced for
      AWS IAM users. A robust password policy helps protect against unauthorized access
      by requiring users to create strong passwords.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to weak or easily guessed passwords. Without a proper password
      policy, accounts are more susceptible to brute force attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Account settings.'
    - Verify that 'Password policy' is enabled and configured with at least the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Enable password expiration.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Account settings.'
    - Enable 'Password policy' and configure the settings to meet the recommended
      criteria.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
