    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive information
      or allow unauthorized data manipulation.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data loss. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates
      these risks and helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to confirm
      bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    - Review bucket policies to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 console for each bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket permissions: aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket
        <bucket-name> --acl private.
