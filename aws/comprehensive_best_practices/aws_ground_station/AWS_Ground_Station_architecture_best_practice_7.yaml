    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and security breaches. Ensuring that buckets
      are private by default protects the data stored within them.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and edit the bucket policy to remove any public access
      permissions.
    - Disable public access settings at both the bucket and account level to enforce
      restrictions.
