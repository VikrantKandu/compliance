    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private by default.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of accidental
      exposure of sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by
      malicious actors to access and potentially manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block
      all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure "Block all public access" is checked.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
