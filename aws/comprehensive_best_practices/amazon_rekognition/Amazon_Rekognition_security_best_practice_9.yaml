    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to programmatically check bucket permissions and policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust IAM policies that might grant unintended access to the bucket.
