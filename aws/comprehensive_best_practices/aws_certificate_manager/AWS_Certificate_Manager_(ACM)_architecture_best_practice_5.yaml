    Title: Ensure that EC2 instances are launched within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and security. Launching instances within a
      VPC allows you to define network configurations, including subnets, route tables,
      and network gateways.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC enhances security by providing
      network isolation and the ability to control inbound and outbound traffic using
      security groups and network ACLs. Instances not within a VPC are at a higher
      risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: "1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.\n2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.\n\
      3. Select \"Instances\" from the left-hand menu.\n4. For each instance, verify\
      \ that the \"VPC ID\" is populated.\n5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI:\n  \
      \ ```\n   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{Instance:InstanceId,VPC:VpcId}'\n\
      \   ```\n   Ensure that each instance has a corresponding VPC ID.\n"
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched within a default VPC if
      no specific VPC is specified.
    Remediation: '1. Identify any instances not launched within a VPC.

      2. Stop the identified instances.

      3. Create a new VPC if one does not exist.

      4. Launch new instances within the created VPC.

      5. Migrate data and configurations from the old instances to the new instances.

      6. Terminate the old instances once the migration is complete.'
