    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches
      and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs may expose EC2 instances to vulnerabilities that
      have been addressed in newer versions. Ensuring the use of the latest AMIs helps
      maintain the security and stability of the environment.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the AMI ID and compare it with the latest AMI
        ID available for the same operating system in the AWS Marketplace or AMI catalog.
    - Step 5: Verify that the AMI ID matches the latest version.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Step 2: Create an AMI backup of the current instance.
    - Step 3: Launch a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Step 4: Migrate data and configurations from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Step 5: Terminate the old instance once the new instance is fully operational.
