    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps to secure
      AWS accounts by requiring users to provide additional verification before accessing
      resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      as it requires more than just a password to authenticate. Without MFA, compromised
      credentials could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list users
      without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users can be created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, select 'Security credentials'.
    - Click on 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
    - Ensure all users complete the MFA setup process.
