    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and pose a security
      risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public reduces the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Save the changes.
