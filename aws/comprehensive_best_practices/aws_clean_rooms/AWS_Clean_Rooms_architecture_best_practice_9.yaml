    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets may have settings that allow public access,
      which can lead to sensitive data being exposed to the internet. Restricting
      public access helps protect data from unauthorized users and potential cyber
      threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements that grant public access.
