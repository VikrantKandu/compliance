    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password.
      Enabling MFA for IAM users helps to prevent unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access,
      potentially resulting in data breaches or unauthorized resource usage. Enabling
      MFA reduces the risk of credential compromise.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select Users.
    - For each user, go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA Device and follow the prompts to enable MFA.
