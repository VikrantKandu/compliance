  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps secure the
      AWS account by requiring additional verification through a second factor, such
      as a mobile device, before granting access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources
      by requiring more than just a password for authentication. Without MFA, a compromised
      password could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      that all users have MFA devices assigned.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without Multi-Factor Authentication
      enabled.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," choose "Manage."
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
