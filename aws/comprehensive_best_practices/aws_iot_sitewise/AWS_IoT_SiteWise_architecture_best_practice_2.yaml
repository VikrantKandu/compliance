    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) that have been approved by the organization. Approved
      AMIs typically include necessary security patches and configurations that comply
      with the organization's security policies.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
      into the environment, as they may not include the latest security patches or
      adhere to the organization's security standards. This can lead to unauthorized
      access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Review the list of running instances and their associated AMIs.
    - Verify that each instance is using an AMI from the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any publicly available
      AMI, which may not be approved by the organization.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances that are not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan and execute a migration strategy to move these instances to approved AMIs.
    - Update the organization's policies and procedures to ensure future instances
      are launched using only approved AMIs.
