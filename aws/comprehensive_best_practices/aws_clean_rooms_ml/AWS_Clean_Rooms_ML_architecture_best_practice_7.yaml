    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users in an AWS
      account. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without
      MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain full access
      to the account. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring a second factor
      for authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to verify if an MFA device is assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Choose 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to assign an MFA device.
