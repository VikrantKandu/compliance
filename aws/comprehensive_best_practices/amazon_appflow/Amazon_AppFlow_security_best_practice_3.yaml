    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing
      a significant security risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access unless configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and access the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
