    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access, which
      could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access settings.
