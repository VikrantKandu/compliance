    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to present two or more separate forms of identification
      before gaining access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, even if the user's password is compromised. Without
      MFA, a compromised password could lead to data breaches, unauthorized resource
      usage, and potential financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab and verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', select 'Manage' and follow the instructions to
      enable MFA for the user.
