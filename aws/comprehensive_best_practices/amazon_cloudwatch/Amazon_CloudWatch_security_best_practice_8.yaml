    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to present additional evidence of
      identity beyond a username and password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from being compromised. Without
      MFA, if a user's credentials are stolen, an attacker can easily gain access
      to AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand navigation pane.
    - Click on the username of the user you want to enable MFA for.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
