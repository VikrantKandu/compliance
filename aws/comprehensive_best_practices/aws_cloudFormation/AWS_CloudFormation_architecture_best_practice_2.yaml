    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized users. Misconfigured bucket permissions are a common
      cause of data breaches, and ensuring restricted access minimizes this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, immediately modify the bucket
      settings to block all public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM roles or users.
    - Review and adjust the ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Regularly monitor and audit bucket settings to maintain compliance.
