    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security.
      MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before accessing
      AWS resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring
      a second form of verification. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      and unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks such as phishing and credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select "Users."
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," choose "Manage" and follow the instructions to
      assign an MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for all users without MFA.
