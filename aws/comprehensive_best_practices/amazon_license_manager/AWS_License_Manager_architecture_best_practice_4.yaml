    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    - Use the Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access at the
      account or bucket level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to block all public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to further
      restrict access to the buckets.
