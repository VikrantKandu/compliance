    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches
      if sensitive data is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default reduces the risk of accidental exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the "Access" column to determine the public
      access status.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and
      verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Save changes to apply the new access settings.
