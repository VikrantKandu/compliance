    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access and data breaches. This check ensures that the bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) do not allow public read or write access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      data manipulation. By restricting public access, you minimize the risk of data
      breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure the bucket policies do not grant public access.
    - Check ACLs to confirm they do not allow public read/write access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to remove public
      access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure they do not grant public read/write access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
