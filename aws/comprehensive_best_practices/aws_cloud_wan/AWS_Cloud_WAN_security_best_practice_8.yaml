  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.
      Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as "Public". 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name, go to the Permissions
      tab, and ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the Permissions
      tab. 4. Edit the Block Public Access settings and ensure that all options to
      block public access are enabled. 5. Review and update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove any statements that allow public access.
