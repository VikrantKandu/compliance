    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Restricting public access mitigates this
      risk and ensures data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - In the 'Permissions' tab, enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and remove any public access policies or ACLs that allow public access.
