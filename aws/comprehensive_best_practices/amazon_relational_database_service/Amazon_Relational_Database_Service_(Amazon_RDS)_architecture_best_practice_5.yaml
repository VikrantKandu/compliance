  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      access to only those who need it minimizes these risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket permissions. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      does not have any public access settings enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check the
      ACL settings for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Edit the bucket policy or ACL to remove
      any public access permissions. 5. Enable the "Block all public access" setting
      for the bucket.
