    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data loss. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket settings and permissions.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and remove any existing bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs)
      that grant public access.
