    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which means they do not allow public read or write access. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public read or write access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACLs for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any bucket policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any statements or permissions that allow public access.
    - Consider enabling block public access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
