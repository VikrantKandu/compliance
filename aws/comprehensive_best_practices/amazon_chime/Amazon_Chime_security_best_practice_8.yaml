  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps to secure
      AWS accounts against unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Without MFA, a compromised username and password can lead to unauthorized
      access to the AWS account. MFA significantly enhances security by requiring
      an additional form of verification.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the
      command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA devices associated with IAM users.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In
      the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the instructions
      to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
