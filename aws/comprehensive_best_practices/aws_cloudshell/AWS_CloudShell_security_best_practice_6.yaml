    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the AWS environment. MFA significantly reduces this risk
      by requiring a second factor that the attacker is unlikely to possess.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking at the "MFA" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab, and then choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA for the user.
