    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires not only
      a password but also a physical or virtual MFA device to access the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If the root account credentials are compromised, the attacker
      would also need access to the MFA device to gain entry, providing an extra layer
      of security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Check if the root account has MFA enabled by looking for the 'MFA enabled' label
      next to the root account user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and verify
      the AccountMFAEnabled field is set to true.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on AWS root accounts.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with the root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to set up a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA setup by entering the generated code from the device.
