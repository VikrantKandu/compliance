    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data being accessed
      by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any that are marked
      as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its properties.
    - Under the 'Permissions' tab, ensure that the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL) do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
