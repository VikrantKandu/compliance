    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Securely Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      unauthorized access and data breaches. It is crucial to secure S3 buckets to
      protect sensitive data from being exposed to the public or unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Misconfigured S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access,
      potentially resulting in data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
      Ensuring proper access controls and encryption settings are in place mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Check that public access settings are correctly configured to prevent unauthorized
      access.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for all buckets.
    - Ensure that versioning and logging are enabled for tracking changes and access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can modify access
      settings.
    Remediation:
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Enable server-side encryption for all S3 buckets.
    - Configure public access settings to block public access where not required.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging to maintain an audit trail of access and
      changes.
