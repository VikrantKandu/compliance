    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could potentially expose sensitive data to the internet. Public access
      to S3 buckets should be restricted to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive information
      and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to confirm the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Re-evaluate the necessity of any public access requirements and apply the principle
      of least privilege.
