    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers
      to access, modify, or delete data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or individual buckets.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure they comply with security
      best practices.
