    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are only accessible via SSH from known IP addresses
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are configured to allow SSH
      access only from known and trusted IP addresses. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your instances.
    Rationale: Allowing SSH access from any IP address increases the risk of unauthorized
      access and potential exploitation by attackers. Restricting access to known
      IP addresses minimizes this risk and enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the Security Groups associated with your EC2 instances.
    - Check the inbound rules for each Security Group to ensure that SSH (port 22)
      is restricted to known IP addresses.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances might be configured with open SSH access
      from any IP address.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Locate the Security Groups associated with your EC2 instances.
    - Edit the inbound rules to restrict SSH access (port 22) to known and trusted
      IP addresses only.
    - Save the changes to apply the updated Security Group settings.
