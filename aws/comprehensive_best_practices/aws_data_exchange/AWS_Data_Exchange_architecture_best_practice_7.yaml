    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes
      the risk of unauthorized access and data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the bucket permissions to ensure it is not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically check the bucket's ACL and bucket
      policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket permissions to remove public access.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access to specific IAM users or
      roles.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent accidental public
      access settings.
