    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, enhancing the security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access. If the root account credentials are compromised, MFA acts as an additional
      barrier, protecting critical resources and data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status of the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account and choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the setup by entering the MFA code generated by the device.
