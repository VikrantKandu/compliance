    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized users
      from accessing sensitive information. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data leaks, compliance violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings and ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access settings.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 Console and select the affected bucket.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
