    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not launched in the default
      VPC. Using a custom VPC allows greater control over network settings and security
      configurations.
    Rationale: Launching instances in the default VPC can lead to security risks due
      to less restrictive network configurations and potential exposure to the internet.
      Custom VPCs provide better security and network management.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the VPC ID under the Description tab.
    - Verify that the VPC ID is not the default VPC ID for the region.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched in the default VPC if
      no other VPC is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running in the default VPC.
    - Create a new custom VPC with appropriate subnets, route tables, and security
      groups.
    - Migrate the instances to the new VPC by creating snapshots, AMIs, and launching
      new instances in the custom VPC.
    - Ensure future instances are launched in the custom VPC by specifying the VPC
      ID during instance creation.
