    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional verification
      beyond just a password. This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, which can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without
      MFA, if a password is compromised, an attacker can easily gain access to your
      account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - For each user, select "Security credentials" and click "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user, choosing either a virtual or
      hardware MFA device.
