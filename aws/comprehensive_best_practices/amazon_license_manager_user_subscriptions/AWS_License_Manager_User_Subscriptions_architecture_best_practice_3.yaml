    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access should be restricted to
      avoid data leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow
        public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Step 5: Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
