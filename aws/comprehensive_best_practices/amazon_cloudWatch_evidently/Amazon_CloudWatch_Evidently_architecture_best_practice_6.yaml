    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized individuals
      and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Disallowing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data. Public buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure, increasing the
      risk of data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      granted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Choose 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      no public access is granted.
