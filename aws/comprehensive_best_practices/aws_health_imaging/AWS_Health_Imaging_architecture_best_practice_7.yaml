    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks have encryption
      enabled for all resources that support encryption, such as S3 buckets, RDS instances,
      and EBS volumes. Encryption protects data at rest, ensuring that sensitive information
      is not accessible to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption for resources managed by CloudFormation stacks
      is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. Without encryption,
      sensitive data may be exposed to security breaches, leading to data loss or
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Review each stack's resources and check if encryption is enabled for resources
      like S3 buckets, RDS instances, and EBS volumes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI or SDK to describe stack resources and verify
      encryption settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, some resources may not have encryption enabled unless
      specified during stack creation.
    Remediation:
    - Update the CloudFormation template to include encryption settings for all applicable
      resources.
    - Redeploy the stack with the updated template to ensure encryption is enabled.
    - Consider using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for managing encryption keys.
