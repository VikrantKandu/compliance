    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. By ensuring buckets
      are private, organizations can protect their data from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to automate these changes across multiple buckets if
      necessary.
