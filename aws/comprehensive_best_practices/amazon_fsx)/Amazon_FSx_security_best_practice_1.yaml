    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure that
      no public access is allowed.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket permissions
      and policy to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to set the bucket ACL to private.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles as needed.
