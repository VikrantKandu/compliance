    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts by requiring a second
      form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to present two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
      This reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used to access sensitive
      data and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' to view the list of IAM users.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the specific user to enable MFA for.
    - Click on 'Security credentials' and manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device to
      the user.
