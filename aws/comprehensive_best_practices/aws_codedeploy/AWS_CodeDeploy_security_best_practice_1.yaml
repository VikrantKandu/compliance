    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches or unauthorized data manipulation.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive information to the public internet. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data against unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to verify that there are no public
      access permissions set.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket ACL and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACLs and bucket policies.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings at both the account and bucket level
      to prevent public access.
