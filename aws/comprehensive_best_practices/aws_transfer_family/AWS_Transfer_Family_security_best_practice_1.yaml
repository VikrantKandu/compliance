    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users with
      console access
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of
      security when accessing AWS services. Enabling MFA for IAM users with console
      access helps protect against unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      full access to the account. MFA adds a second layer of security, requiring users
      to provide a second form of verification, which significantly reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Ensure that MFA is enabled for each user with console access.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
