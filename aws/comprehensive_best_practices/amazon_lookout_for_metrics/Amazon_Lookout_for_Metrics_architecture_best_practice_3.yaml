    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to maintain the
      confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in S3 buckets by restricting
      public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      minimizes the risk of data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and
      ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check the permissions of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not allow
      public access.
