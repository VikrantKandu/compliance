    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to significant
      security incidents if sensitive data is unintentionally exposed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
