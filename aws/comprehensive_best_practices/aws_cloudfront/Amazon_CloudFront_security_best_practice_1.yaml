    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data
      breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access or modify data. Restricting access to only authorized users helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that no public access
      settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not grant public access.
    - Check the bucket policy using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> and ensure there are no statements allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket permissions
      to remove public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users or roles.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for all buckets in the AWS Management
      Console.
