    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and update them according to the principle
      of least privilege.
