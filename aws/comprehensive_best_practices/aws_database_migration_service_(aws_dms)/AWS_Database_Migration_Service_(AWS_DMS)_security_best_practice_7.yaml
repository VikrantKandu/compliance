    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on your
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires a second form
      of authentication, which helps protect your account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account enhances security by requiring a second
      form of verification. Without MFA, if the root account credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full control over the AWS environment, leading to potential
      data loss, service disruption, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section for the MFA status of the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled and configured correctly for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, select 'Activate MFA on your root account.'
    - Follow the prompts to set up and activate MFA using a hardware or virtual MFA
      device.
