    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and look for any public access settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy does not grant public access using the command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policy statements that allow public access.
    - Update the bucket's ACL to remove any public access grants.
    - Consider enabling the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
