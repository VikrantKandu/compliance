    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances do not have public IP
      addresses unless necessary. Publicly accessible instances can be exposed to
      the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible EC2 instances can lead to potential security breaches
      and unauthorized access. Limiting public access reduces the attack surface and
      helps protect sensitive data and resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left navigation pane.
    - Check the 'Public IPv4 address' column for each instance.
    - Verify that instances without a specific need for public access do not have
      a public IP address.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with or without a public
      IP address based on the subnet settings.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances that are publicly accessible without a valid reason.
    - Modify the instance settings to remove the public IP address.
    - Consider using a bastion host or VPN for secure access to instances that require
      external connectivity.
