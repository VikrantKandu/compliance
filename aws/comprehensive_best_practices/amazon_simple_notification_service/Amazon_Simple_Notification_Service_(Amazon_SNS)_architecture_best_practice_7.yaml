    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that the bucket policy does
      not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACLs do not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - For any bucket found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket ACLs to ensure that no public permissions are granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent any future public access configurations.
