    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive information to the internet, leading to compliance violations and
      reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be altered
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and access the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to ensure no public access is granted.
