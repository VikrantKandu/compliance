  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      security risks and helps maintain data confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to check
      ACL settings and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to review
      bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the bucket
      policy and ACL settings. 2. Remove any statements in the bucket policy that
      allow public access. 3. Adjust the ACL to restrict access to authorized users
      only. 4. Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
