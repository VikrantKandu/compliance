    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by requiring a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to credential theft and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the "Users" section to see if MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify MFA devices are assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - Click on the specific user and navigate to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" and follow the instructions to enable
      MFA.
    - Ensure that users are informed to set up their MFA devices promptly.
