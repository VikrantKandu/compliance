    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure, making it
      crucial to restrict access to only those who need it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Restricting access to only authorized users
      mitigates these risks and ensures data security and compliance with privacy
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has "Public" access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' to programmatically check the
      ACL settings of each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy' to review bucket policies
      for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket's permissions to remove public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to ensure compliance.
