    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public access can be restricted by configuring bucket
      policies, access control lists (ACLs), and enabling the S3 Block Public Access
      feature.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and
      integrity.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Navigate to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Step 3: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Step 5: Review the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Step 6: Check the ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Navigate to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 3: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Enable "Block all public access" if it is not already enabled.
    - Step 5: Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
        access.
    - Step 6: Modify the ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Step 7: Use the AWS CLI or SDK to automate the remediation steps if necessary.
