  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Versioning Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps to preserve, retrieve, and
      restore every version of every object stored in a bucket. This is crucial for
      data protection and recovery.
  - Rationale: Versioning provides an additional layer of protection by retaining
      multiple versions of an object, which is useful for recovering from both unintended
      user actions and application failures. Without versioning, accidental deletions
      or overwrites could result in data loss.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to check. 4. Go to the Properties tab. 5. Check
      if Versioning is listed under the bucket properties. 6. Ensure that Versioning
      is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have versioning disabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket for which you want to enable versioning. 4. Go to the Properties
      tab. 5. Click on the Versioning section. 6. Enable versioning and save the changes.
