    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to data
      leaks and compromise sensitive information, posing significant security and
      compliance risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that all public access is
      blocked.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access, and permissions
      need to be explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
