    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Within VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private
      Cloud (VPC) to enhance security and control network access.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides better network isolation
      and security. It allows for more granular control over network configurations
      and access, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Verify that all instances are associated with a VPC by checking the VPC ID column
      in the instance details.
    Default Value: By default, new AWS accounts have a default VPC in each region,
      and instances are launched within this VPC unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any EC2 instances not within a VPC.
    - Stop the instance if running.
    - Create a new VPC or use an existing one.
    - Launch a new instance within the VPC with the same configuration.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance.
