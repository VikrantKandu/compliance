    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private
      by default. It is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored
      in S3.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets should be private to protect data from unauthorized
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of
      sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no buckets are publicly accessible unless explicitly intended.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are public by default unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings by disabling public access.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is private.
