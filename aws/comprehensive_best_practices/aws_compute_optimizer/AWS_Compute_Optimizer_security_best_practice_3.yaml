    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not public helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket policies
      and ACLs and verify that they do not permit public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings in the S3 console to prevent public access
      to the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
