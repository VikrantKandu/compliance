    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. Public access should be restricted
      to prevent data breaches and maintain data privacy.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any policies or ACLs that grant public read or write access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and update them to ensure compliance with
      security policies.
