  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts, as it requires an additional authentication factor beyond just a password.
      Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and password
      theft.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Check the "MFA" column to ensure
      that MFA is enabled for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the "Security credentials" tab. 6. Under
      "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)", choose "Manage". 7. Follow the on-screen
      instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
