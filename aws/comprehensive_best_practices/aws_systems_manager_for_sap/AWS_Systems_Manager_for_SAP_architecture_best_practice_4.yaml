    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps safeguard
      sensitive data stored in S3 by encrypting it using AES-256 or AWS KMS-managed
      keys.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets is crucial to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 could be vulnerable to unauthorized access or exposure in
      the event of a security incident.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket to review.
    - Step 4: Check the properties of the bucket to verify if server-side encryption
        is enabled.
    - Step 5: Confirm that the encryption setting is either AES-256 or AWS KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Step 4: Go to the bucket properties.
    - Step 5: Enable server-side encryption by selecting either AES-256 or AWS KMS
        as the encryption method.
    - Step 6: Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
