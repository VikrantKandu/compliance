    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides enhanced security
      by automatically encrypting data before it is stored and decrypting it when
      accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data stored
      in S3 from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data at rest may be vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check the properties of each bucket.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket. This can be done
      by checking the bucket properties for an encryption configuration.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the bucket properties and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the encryption option that best fits your security requirements (e.g.,
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
