    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can be a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      network traffic, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and attacks. Custom
      security groups should be used to restrict access to only necessary ports and
      IP addresses.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Ensure none of the instances are associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be associated with the default security
      group.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the instances.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
