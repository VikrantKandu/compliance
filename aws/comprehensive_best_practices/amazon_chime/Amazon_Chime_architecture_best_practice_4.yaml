    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Public access can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data loss and compliance
      violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block
      public access" settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Review bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access, but existing buckets
      may have different settings.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab and enable "Block all public access." 5. Review and modify bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
