    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This security check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access to only authorized users
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
      4. Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access. 5. Use
      the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify configurations programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access. 2. Update the bucket ACL to remove any public permissions. 3. Enable
      S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets to prevent
      public access.
