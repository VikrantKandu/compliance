    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect against unauthorized
      access, as it requires a second form of authentication in addition to the password.
      Without MFA, the root account is vulnerable to attacks such as password guessing
      or credential theft, which can lead to unauthorized access to all resources
      in the AWS account.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the root account. 5. Check
      if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. In the 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)' section, choose 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the prompts to set up a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device. 5. Confirm the setup to enable MFA on the
      root account.
