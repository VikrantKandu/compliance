    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you reduce the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, which
      can lead to data leaks and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of your
      data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify that no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Under "Block public access", click "Edit".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
