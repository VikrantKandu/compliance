  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, posing a significant security risk.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring that buckets are private helps to protect sensitive information
      and comply with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public
      permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and remove any public
      access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL. 4. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private to set the bucket
      to private.
