    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Limiting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs programmatically and
      verify the settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
