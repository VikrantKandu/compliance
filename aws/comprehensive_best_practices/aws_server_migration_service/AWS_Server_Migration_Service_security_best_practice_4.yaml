    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that your Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to
      data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and public access settings.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled unless public access
      is explicitly required.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any policies allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the bucket's access settings.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket's permissions.
    - Remove any policies or ACLs that grant public access unless explicitly required
      for the application.
