    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless
      explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and
      pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data leaks. Limiting access to only necessary users or
      services minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with public access.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings
      to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings in the S3 console to ensure public access
      is blocked.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public permissions.
