    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, posing
      a security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      reduces these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access settings or policies that
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
