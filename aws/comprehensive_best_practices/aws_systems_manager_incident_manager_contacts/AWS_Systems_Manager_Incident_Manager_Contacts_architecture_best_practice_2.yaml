    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Publicly
      accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information
      and maintains data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify bucket permissions.
    Default Value: New S3 buckets are private by default with 'Block all public access'
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and edit the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' under the bucket's settings.
    - Use AWS CLI to apply changes: aws s3api put-bucket-policy and adjust permissions
        accordingly.
