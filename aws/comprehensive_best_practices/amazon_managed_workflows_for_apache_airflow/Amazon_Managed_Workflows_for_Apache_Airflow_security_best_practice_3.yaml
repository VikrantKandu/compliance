    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is stored within them.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies to ensure that 'Block Public Access'
      settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
