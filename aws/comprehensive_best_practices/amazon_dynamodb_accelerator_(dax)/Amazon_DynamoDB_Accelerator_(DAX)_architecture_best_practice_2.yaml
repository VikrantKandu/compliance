    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security updates
      and features.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs may expose instances to security vulnerabilities
      and bugs that have been fixed in newer versions. Ensuring the use of the latest
      AMIs helps maintain security and performance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and verify the AMI ID used for each instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the desired operating system.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified
      at launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the latest AMI for the desired operating system from the AWS Marketplace
      or official documentation.
    - Launch new instances using the latest AMI.
    - Consider creating a plan to regularly update instances to the latest AMI version.
