    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data
      exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the settings.
