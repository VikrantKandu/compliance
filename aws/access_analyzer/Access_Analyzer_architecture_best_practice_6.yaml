    ID: AWS-EC2-001
    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Approved AMIs are those that have been vetted
      for security and compliance by your organization.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can expose your instances to vulnerabilities,
      outdated software, or misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
      Ensuring that instances use approved AMIs helps maintain a secure and compliant
      environment.
    Audit: '1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

      2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

      3. Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu.

      4. For each instance, check the AMI ID.

      5. Verify that the AMI ID matches one of the approved AMI IDs listed by your
      organization.

      6. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances --query
      ''Reservations[*].Instances[*].ImageId''` to list all AMI IDs in use and cross-reference
      them with the approved list.

      '
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
    Remediation: '1. Identify instances not using approved AMIs.

      2. Create a new instance using an approved AMI.

      3. Migrate the necessary data and configurations to the new instance.

      4. Terminate the non-compliant instance.

      5. Update policies and IAM roles to restrict the use of unapproved AMIs.'
