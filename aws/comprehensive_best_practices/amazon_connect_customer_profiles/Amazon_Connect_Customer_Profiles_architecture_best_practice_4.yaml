    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private protects data
      integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a bucket policy or ACL that allows public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check for public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove or modify the bucket
      policy or ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket's permissions.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
