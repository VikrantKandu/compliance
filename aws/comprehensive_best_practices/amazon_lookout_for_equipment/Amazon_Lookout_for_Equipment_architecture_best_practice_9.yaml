    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing
      account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is exposed, an attacker could gain full access
      to the AWS account. MFA provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized
      access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left pane, click on Users. 4. For each user, check if MFA is enabled
      by looking at the "MFA Device" column. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically verify MFA
      status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Click on Users in the left pane. 4. Select the user for whom you want to
      enable MFA. 5. Click on the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA) section, click on Assign MFA device. 7. Follow the instructions
      to assign and configure an MFA device for the user.
