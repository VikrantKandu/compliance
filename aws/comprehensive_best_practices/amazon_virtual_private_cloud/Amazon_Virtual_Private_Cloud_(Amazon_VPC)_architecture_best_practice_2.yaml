    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks, compliance violations, and reputational damage. Restricting
      public access reduces these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to check.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that all public access is
      blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm there are
      no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
