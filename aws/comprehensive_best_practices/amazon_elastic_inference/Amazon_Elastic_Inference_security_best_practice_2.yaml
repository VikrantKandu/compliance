    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      to prevent unauthorized access. S3 buckets should only be accessible to specific
      IAM users or roles as per the organization's access policies.
    Rationale: Setting S3 buckets to private prevents unauthorized access and data
      breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure and
      compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but policies and settings
      can be changed to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and update the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' setting to ensure the bucket remains private.
