    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and should be restricted to maintain data privacy and security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible reduces the risk of sensitive data being exposed to unauthorized
      users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a policy that allows public access.
    - Check bucket ACLs to ensure they do not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
