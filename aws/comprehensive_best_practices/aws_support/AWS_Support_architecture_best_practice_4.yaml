    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that S3 bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) are configured to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status to programmatically
      check the policy status for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
