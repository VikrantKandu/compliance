    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access. This involves setting bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
    Rationale: S3 buckets are often used to store sensitive data, including personal
      information, financial records, and proprietary business information. If a bucket
      is publicly accessible, it can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational
      damage. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to restrict public access.
