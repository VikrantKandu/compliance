    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled on the AWS root
      account to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of
      the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial as it prevents unauthorized
      access even if the password is compromised. The root account has unrestricted
      access to all resources, and a security breach could lead to data loss, service
      disruption, or unauthorized billing.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the Security Status section on the dashboard.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the Security Status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the steps to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
