    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets allow public access,
      which can lead to data exposure if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all buckets and check the 'Access' column for each bucket.
    - Verify that each bucket is marked as 'Private'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private but can be made public through
      misconfiguration.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to secure.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
