    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to configure bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to prevent public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket allows public access by checking the "Block Public Access"
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any S3 buckets with public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any Allow statements that grant public access.
    - Update ACLs to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
