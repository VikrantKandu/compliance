    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, compromised credentials can
      lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions within AWS accounts.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled. This can be done by selecting the user
      and viewing the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that all users have MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device
      to the user.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users without MFA.
