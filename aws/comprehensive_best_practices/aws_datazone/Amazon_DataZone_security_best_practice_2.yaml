  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are within VPC
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and security. Using a VPC provides additional
      security controls such as security groups and network access control lists.
  - Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC enhances security by providing
      network isolation and enabling the use of security features like security groups
      and NACLs. Instances outside a VPC may be exposed to unnecessary risks, such
      as unauthorized access and data breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the list of running instances.
    - Verify that each instance has a VPC ID associated with it.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched within the default VPC if
      no specific VPC is chosen.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify instances not within a VPC.
    - Stop the instances.
    - Create or identify an existing VPC.
    - Launch new instances within the VPC.
    - Migrate any necessary data or configurations to the new instances.
