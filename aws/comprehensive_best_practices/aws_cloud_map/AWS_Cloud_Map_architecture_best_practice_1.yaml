  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access helps secure data and maintain privacy.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure 'Block Public
      Access' settings are enabled for the bucket. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket ACL does
      not allow public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure the bucket policy does not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable 'Block
      Public Access' settings for the bucket. 5. Review and modify the bucket ACL
      and bucket policy to restrict public access. 6. Use AWS CLI commands to update
      bucket policies and ACLs if necessary.
