    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and information leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. It is crucial to restrict
      access to only authorized users to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to grant access to specific
      users or roles only.
