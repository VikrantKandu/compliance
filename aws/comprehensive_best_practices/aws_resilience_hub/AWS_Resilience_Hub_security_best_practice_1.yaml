    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to deny public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive
      data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring S3 buckets
      are not public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure "Block all public access"
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow
      public access.
