    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and not publicly accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets in the account.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions to ensure that the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging to track changes and access.
    - Consider using AWS Config or Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to enforce
      bucket privacy.
