    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Unrestricted public access can lead to accidental data leaks
      and compliance violations, especially if sensitive information is stored in
      the buckets.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket permissions.
    - Ensure there are no 'Everyone' or 'Authenticated Users' permissions set.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and remove any public access policies or bucket ACLs that allow public
      access.
