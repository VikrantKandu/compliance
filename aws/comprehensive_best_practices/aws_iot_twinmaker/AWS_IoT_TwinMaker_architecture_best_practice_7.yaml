    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that the AWS root account has Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      an additional authentication factor beyond the password to access the account,
      helping to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the AWS account, making it a prime target for attackers. Without MFA, if
      the root account password is compromised, an attacker can gain full control
      over the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the AccountMFAEnabled field.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, find the option to activate MFA on the root
      account.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA, choosing either a virtual or hardware MFA
      device.
    - Complete the setup process by scanning the QR code or entering the MFA serial
      number and authentication code.
