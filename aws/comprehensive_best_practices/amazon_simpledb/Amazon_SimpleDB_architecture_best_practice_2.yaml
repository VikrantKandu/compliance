    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification
      step during the login process.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account provides an extra layer of security
      beyond just a password. If the root account is compromised, an attacker could
      have full access to all resources in the AWS account, leading to potential data
      breaches or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console using the root account.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device
      for the root account.
