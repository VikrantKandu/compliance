    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is important to
      restrict access to S3 buckets to prevent data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and security breaches. Restricting access helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Review the Bucket Policy and Access Control List to ensure there are no public
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable the Block all public access setting.
    - Review and modify the Bucket Policy and Access Control List to remove any public
      permissions.
