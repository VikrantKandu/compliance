    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all EC2 instances are not associated with the default
      security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound access, which
      can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unauthorized access to
      your instances because it allows all inbound traffic. This check ensures that
      instances are secured with custom security groups that have more restrictive
      rules.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if not specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per
      your security requirements.
    - Detach the default security group and attach the new security group to the instances.
