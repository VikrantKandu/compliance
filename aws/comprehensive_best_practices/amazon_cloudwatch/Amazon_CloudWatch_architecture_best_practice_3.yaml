    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for public indicators.
      4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and navigate to the Permissions
      tab. 5. Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to have public access, navigate to the Permissions
      tab. 2. Modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions. 3. Adjust
      the ACL settings to ensure that no public access is granted. 4. Utilize the
      S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
