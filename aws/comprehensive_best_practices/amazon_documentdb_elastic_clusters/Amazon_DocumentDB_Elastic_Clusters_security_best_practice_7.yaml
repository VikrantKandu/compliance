  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible protects against unauthorized data access.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs to verify
      public access settings.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Utilize the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
