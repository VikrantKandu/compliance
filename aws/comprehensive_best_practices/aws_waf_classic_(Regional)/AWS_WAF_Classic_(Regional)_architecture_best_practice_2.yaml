    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data leakage and exposure to malicious activities.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by attackers to access
      or manipulate sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Check for any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access.
