    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all traffic from within
      the group and can be a security risk if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended access to your
      EC2 instances, as it allows inbound and outbound traffic from all instances
      associated with it. This can result in unauthorized access and potential data
      breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that no instance is using the default
      security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group if
      no other group is specified.
    Remediation: 1. Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound
      rules tailored to your application's needs. 2. Disassociate the default security
      group from the EC2 instances. 3. Associate the newly created security group
      with the instances.
