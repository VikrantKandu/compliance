  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      additional verification beyond just a password, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring a second form of authentication,
      which significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially through phishing attacks
      or password breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "Security
      credentials" tab. 5. Verify that "Assigned MFA device" is not empty.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select a user and go
      to the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Click "Manage MFA device" and follow the
      instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
