    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that AWS S3 buckets do not have public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as they allow
      anyone on the internet to access the stored data. Ensuring S3 buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect sensitive information and complies with data
      protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to check for public access configurations.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to adjust permissions or the AWS CLI to update
      the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
