  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized users. Public buckets can lead to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings. 4. Ensure that
      all options under "Block Public Access" are enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on "Permissions" and then "Block
      Public Access." 4. Enable all options under "Block Public Access." 5. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
