    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users with console access
      to enhance security by requiring a second factor of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. If MFA is not enabled, unauthorized users who obtain a user's
      credentials can gain access to the AWS Management Console, potentially leading
      to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click on 'Manage' under the 'Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)' section.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
