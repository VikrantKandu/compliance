    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible by default helps mitigate these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the bucket policy status programmatically.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket ACL programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to restrict public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Verify that the changes have been applied successfully by checking the bucket
      policy and ACL again.
