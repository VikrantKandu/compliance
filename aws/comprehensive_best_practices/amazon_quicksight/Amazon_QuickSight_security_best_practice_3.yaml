    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this
      risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Access' column for each bucket to ensure it is not marked as 'Public'.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      verify the ACL settings do not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket policy using 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab and adjust the bucket ACL and bucket policy to
      remove public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
