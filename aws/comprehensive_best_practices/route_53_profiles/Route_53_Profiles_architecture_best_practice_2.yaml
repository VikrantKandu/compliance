    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check ACL settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket to configure.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review bucket policies and remove any statements that allow public access.
