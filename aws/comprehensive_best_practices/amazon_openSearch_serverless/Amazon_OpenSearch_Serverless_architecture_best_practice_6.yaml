    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches, exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check the bucket policy for any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to verify bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
