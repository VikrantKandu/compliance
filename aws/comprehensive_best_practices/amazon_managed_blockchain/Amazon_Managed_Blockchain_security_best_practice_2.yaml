    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password by requiring
      a second factor of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access, especially in scenarios where passwords are compromised. Without MFA,
      users are vulnerable to phishing attacks, password leaks, and other security
      threats.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select the user for whom you want to enable
      MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device to the user.
