    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. It is crucial to restrict
      public access to prevent data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view its properties.
    - Check the "Permissions" tab to review the bucket's public access settings.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
