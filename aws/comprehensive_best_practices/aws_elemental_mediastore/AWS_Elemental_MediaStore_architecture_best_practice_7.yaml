    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS environment from
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to unauthorized
      access, potentially resulting in data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security Credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
