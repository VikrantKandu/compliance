    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification step
      during sign-in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account provides an extra layer of security,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, the root account is vulnerable
      to attacks that could compromise the entire AWS environment.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Check the 'MFA' column for the
      root account to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)', select 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the instructions to set up a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device.
