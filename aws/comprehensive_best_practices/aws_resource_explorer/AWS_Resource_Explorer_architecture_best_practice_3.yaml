    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, restricting public access. This is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data stored in S3 buckets from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and ensure the ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is private.
