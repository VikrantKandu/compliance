  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data,
      posing a significant security risk.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to safeguard data
      against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive information and lead to compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Check the "Block all public
      access" settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" on the bucket settings. 2. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access. 3. Use AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to the buckets.
