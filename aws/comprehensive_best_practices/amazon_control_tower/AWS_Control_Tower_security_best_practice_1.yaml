    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to data leaks,
      financial loss, and damage to reputation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
