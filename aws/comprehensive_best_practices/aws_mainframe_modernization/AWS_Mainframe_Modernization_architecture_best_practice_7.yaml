    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a password by requiring users to provide a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect their credentials from being
      compromised. If MFA is not enabled, there is a higher risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources, which could lead to data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled by looking at the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to programmatically
      check for users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: IAM users do not have MFA enabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user name to open the user details page.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab, and then choose Manage next to Assigned
      MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
