    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environments by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification.
      Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access in
      case credentials are compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized
      actions, data breaches, and potential financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA device and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
