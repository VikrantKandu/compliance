    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps in protecting sensitive data stored in S3 from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed to unauthorized users. Restricting public access helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open its properties.
    - Check the 'Permissions' tab to ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any bucket policy that allows public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure it does not grant public read or write permissions.
