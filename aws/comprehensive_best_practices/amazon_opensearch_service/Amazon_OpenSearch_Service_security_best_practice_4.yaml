  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
  - Rationale: Using unapproved or outdated AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and
      inconsistencies in your environment. Approved AMIs are vetted for security and
      compliance, reducing the risk of exposure to vulnerabilities.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. List all running instances and identify the AMI ID used for each instance.
      4. Compare the AMI IDs against a list of approved AMIs maintained by your organization.
      5. Verify that all instances are using approved AMIs.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any available AMI.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances not using approved AMIs. 2. Plan for the replacement
      of these instances with new ones using approved AMIs. 3. Terminate the non-compliant
      instances once the new instances are operational. 4. Update organizational policies
      to enforce the use of approved AMIs during instance launch.
