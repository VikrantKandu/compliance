    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides an additional
      layer of security by encrypting data stored in S3, which helps protect against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Without encryption, data stored in S3 can be vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, especially if access controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the bucket properties and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method, such as AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer-managed
      keys (SSE-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
