    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      sensitive data can be exposed to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private
      protects against unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
