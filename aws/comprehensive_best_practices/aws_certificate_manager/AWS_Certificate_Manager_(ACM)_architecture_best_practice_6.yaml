    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can pose a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      your instances to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Step 5: Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify all EC2 instances associated with the default security group.
    - Step 2: Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules
        as per your security policy.
    - Step 3: Associate the new security group with the identified EC2 instances.
    - Step 4: Remove the default security group association from those instances.
