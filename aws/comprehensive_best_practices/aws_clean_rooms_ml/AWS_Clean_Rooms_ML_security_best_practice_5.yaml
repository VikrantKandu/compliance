    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps protect data against
      unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access and could lead to data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI with the command: aws s3api get-bucket-encryption
        --bucket <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the properties tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
