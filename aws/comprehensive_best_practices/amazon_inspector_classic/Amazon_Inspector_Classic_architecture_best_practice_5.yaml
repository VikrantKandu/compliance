    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a password, requiring users
      to provide a second form of authentication, typically a temporary code generated
      by a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker could gain full access to the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring
      an additional authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Review the MFA column to verify that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to enable a virtual MFA device for the user.
