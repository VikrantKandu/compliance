    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Limiting access to only
      authorized users mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - Verify that no buckets have public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not have public access enabled.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to edit the bucket permissions.
    - Remove any public access granted through the bucket policy or access control
      list (ACL).
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for more granular
      access control.
