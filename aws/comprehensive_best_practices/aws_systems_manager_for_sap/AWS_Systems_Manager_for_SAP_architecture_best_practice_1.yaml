  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a public access setting or any public read/write
      permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public
      access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
