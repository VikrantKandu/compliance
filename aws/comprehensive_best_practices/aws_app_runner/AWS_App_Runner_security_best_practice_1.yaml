    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide not only a password but also a second
      factor, such as a code from a smartphone app or a hardware token, to access
      AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      a second form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify that each user has an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
