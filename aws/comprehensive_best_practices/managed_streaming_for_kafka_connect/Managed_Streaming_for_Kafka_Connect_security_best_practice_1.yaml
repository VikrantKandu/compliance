    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to stored data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to modify the bucket permissions and block
      all public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
