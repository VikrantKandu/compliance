    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS account by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors
      to gain access. It is an essential security measure for protecting sensitive
      information and resources.
    Rationale: "Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized\
      \ access due to compromised credentials. Without MFA, an attacker only needs\
      \ to acquire a user\u2019s password to gain access, which could lead to data\
      \ breaches and unauthorized resource usage."
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, select 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)' in the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and enable MFA for the user.
