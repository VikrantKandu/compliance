    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to the stored data. S3 buckets should not be
      publicly accessible unless explicitly required and approved.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private protects sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to
      the internet, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
