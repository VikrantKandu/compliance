    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide more than one form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      by requiring a second factor for authentication. Without MFA, unauthorized users
      could gain access to AWS resources if they obtain a user's password.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the "MFA" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      MFA devices and verify that each user has an associated MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users."
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab and click "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
