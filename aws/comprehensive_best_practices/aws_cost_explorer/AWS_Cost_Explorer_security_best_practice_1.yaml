    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets are a common source of data leaks. By
      ensuring buckets are private, you minimize the risk of unauthorized access and
      data exposure, which can have severe financial and reputational consequences.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has "Public" access enabled under the "Access" column.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no bucket policy grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and adjust the bucket policy to remove public access.
    - Use the "Block public access" settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    - Confirm changes by reviewing the bucket's access permissions.
