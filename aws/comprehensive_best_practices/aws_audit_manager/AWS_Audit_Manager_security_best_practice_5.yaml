    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide not only a password but
      also a second form of verification, such as a code from a mobile app or hardware
      token. This helps protect accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, accounts are more
      vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      actions within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Multi-Factor Authentication' column to verify if MFA
      is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
