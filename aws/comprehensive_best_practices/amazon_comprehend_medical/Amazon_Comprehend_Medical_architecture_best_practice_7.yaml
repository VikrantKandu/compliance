  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private protects data confidentiality and
      integrity.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that no buckets have public access settings enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Implement bucket policies and access control lists to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
