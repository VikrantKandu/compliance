    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure and enhances security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket permissions
      and verify that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible when created.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings.
    - Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to further restrict
      access to authorized users only.
