    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive information to the internet, leading to potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
