    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA adds an additional layer of security to your AWS environment
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication. This helps protect
      accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials, which can
      lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources, potentially resulting in data
      breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
