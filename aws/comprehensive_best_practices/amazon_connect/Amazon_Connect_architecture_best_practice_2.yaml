    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict bucket
      access to only those who require it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. By ensuring buckets are private, you
      mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Check for any bucket policy or ACL that allows public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public read or write access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to update the bucket settings to private.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
