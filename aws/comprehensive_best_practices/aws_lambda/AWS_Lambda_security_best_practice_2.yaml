    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches and unauthorized
      data manipulation. Restricting access to only authorized users helps protect
      sensitive data and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block public access settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block all public access on the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
