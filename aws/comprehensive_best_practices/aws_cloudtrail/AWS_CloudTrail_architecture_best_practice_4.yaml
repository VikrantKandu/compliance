    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are not associated with
      the default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and
      outbound traffic, which can pose a security risk if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      EC2 instances to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches. Ensuring that instances are associated with custom
      security groups allows for more granular control over network traffic.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the security group associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with the default security
      group, which allows all traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the affected instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
