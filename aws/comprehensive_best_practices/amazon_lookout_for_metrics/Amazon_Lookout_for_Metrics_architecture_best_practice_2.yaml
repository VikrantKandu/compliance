    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and should be avoided
      unless absolutely necessary for business requirements.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions or policies.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Re-evaluate bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
