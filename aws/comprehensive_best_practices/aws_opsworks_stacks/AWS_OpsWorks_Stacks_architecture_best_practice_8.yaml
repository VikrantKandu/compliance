    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to present a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review the 'MFA' column for each user to verify MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)', click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the steps to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
