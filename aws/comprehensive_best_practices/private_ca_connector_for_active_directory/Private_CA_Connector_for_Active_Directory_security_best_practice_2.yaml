    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps to maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to restrict public access at the bucket
      level.
    - Re-evaluate permissions regularly to ensure compliance.
