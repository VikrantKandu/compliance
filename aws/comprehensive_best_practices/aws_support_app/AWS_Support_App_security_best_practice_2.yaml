    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for the AWS root account to provide an
      additional layer of security. MFA requires users to provide a second factor
      of authentication in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If an attacker gains access to the root account, they can
      potentially compromise the entire AWS environment. MFA adds an extra layer of
      security by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and then click on the root account.
    - Check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Click on 'Activate MFA' and follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual
      MFA device, U2F security key, or other supported MFA device.
