    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is crucial to configure
      S3 bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to prevent public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not public protects sensitive information
      and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket policy and ACLs. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access and that the ACLs do not grant public read
      or write permissions. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and
      ACLs. 2. Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access to the
      bucket. 3. Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance
      with security best practices.
