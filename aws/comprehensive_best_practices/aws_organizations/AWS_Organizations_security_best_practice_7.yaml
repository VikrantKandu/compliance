    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to data exposure and
      potential data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they
      do not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket policy for statements that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access to all or specific
      buckets.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
