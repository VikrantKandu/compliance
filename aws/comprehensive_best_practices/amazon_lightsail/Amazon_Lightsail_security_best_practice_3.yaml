    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users
      to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      could gain access to the AWS environment, potentially leading to data breaches
      or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA enabled' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor Authentication section, choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
