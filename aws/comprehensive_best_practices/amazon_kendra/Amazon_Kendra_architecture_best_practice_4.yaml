    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      required. This ensures that sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed to the
      public internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and view the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public
      access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
