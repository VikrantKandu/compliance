    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to only authorized users mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Disable public access to the bucket by updating the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access at both the account and bucket levels.
    - Review and update IAM policies to ensure only authorized users have access to
      the S3 bucket.
