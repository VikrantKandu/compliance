  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data leaks and unauthorized use.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to only
      authorized users reduces the risk of data exposure.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure all options are enabled. 5. Verify that the bucket
      policy and ACL do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the non-compliant bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to
      restrict public access.
