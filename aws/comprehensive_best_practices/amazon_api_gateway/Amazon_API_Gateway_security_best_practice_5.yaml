    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide two or more verification
      factors to gain access. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access
      even if their password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
