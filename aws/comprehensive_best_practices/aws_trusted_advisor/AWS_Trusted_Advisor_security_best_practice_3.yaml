    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce the
      risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to compliance violations
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their access permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      verify the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access settings
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to update the bucket policy to restrict
      access only to authorized users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or specific buckets to
      prevent future public access configurations.
