  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS Management Console by requiring users to provide additional authentication
      information beyond just their password. This practice helps to protect user
      accounts from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, unauthorized users
      can gain access to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches or service
      disruptions.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA Device' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to ensure each user has an MFA device assigned.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Select 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' and follow the instructions
      to assign an MFA device.
