    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity. Unrestricted public access can lead to data leaks,
      unauthorized data manipulation, and potential legal issues.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions to ensure that no public access is granted.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to verify that public access is restricted.
    - Optionally, use AWS CLI or AWS Config to list bucket permissions and verify
      the absence of public access policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Block Public Access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
