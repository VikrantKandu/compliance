    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to
      S3 buckets should be restricted to prevent data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and security breaches. Restricting access helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you wish to audit.
    - Check the bucket's permissions settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled by reviewing the
      'Block Public Access' settings and bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' if it is not already enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure
      no public access is granted.
