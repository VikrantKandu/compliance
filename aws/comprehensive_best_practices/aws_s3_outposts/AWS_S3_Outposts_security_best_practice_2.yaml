    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      access to only authorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect sensitive
      data and maintains compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy or ACL that allows public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify bucket permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy or ACL to remove
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to update the permissions.
    - Consider using AWS IAM policies to further restrict access to the bucket.
