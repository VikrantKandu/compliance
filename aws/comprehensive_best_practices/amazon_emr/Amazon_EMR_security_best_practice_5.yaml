    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors,
      leading to data leakage and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block Public Access' settings
      are enabled for all buckets.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to check
      the bucket ACLs and confirm no public access permissions are granted.
    - Review bucket policies and ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Update bucket policies to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Review and modify bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
