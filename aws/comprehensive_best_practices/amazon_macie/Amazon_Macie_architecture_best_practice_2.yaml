    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and ensures compliance with security best practices. Public access
      can lead to data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that public access is
      blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically list and review bucket policies and ACLs
      for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
