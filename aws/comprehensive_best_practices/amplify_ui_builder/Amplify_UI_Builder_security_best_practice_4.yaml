    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Public buckets can
      be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security threat
      if sensitive data is stored.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Remove any bucket policy or ACL that grants public access.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies to restrict access to only authorized users
      or roles.
