    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a username and password by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, there is a higher risk of account compromise
      through credential theft or brute force attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the specific user name.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device for the user.
