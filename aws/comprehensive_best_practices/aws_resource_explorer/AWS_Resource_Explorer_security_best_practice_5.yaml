    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible protects sensitive information and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public access settings" to ensure that "Block all
      public access" is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket's ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
