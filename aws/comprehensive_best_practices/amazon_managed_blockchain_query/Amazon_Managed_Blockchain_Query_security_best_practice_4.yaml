    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the properties. 4. Verify that server-side encryption
      is enabled for each bucket. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is not compliant. 4. Go to the properties of the bucket.
      5. Enable server-side encryption by selecting an encryption method (e.g., AES-256
      or AWS-KMS). 6. Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
