  - Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: CloudTrail should be enabled in all AWS regions to ensure that all
      account activity is logged for security and compliance purposes. This enables
      tracking of changes to AWS resources and helps in identifying unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions helps to ensure that all actions
      taken in the AWS account are logged. This is crucial for security audits, incident
      investigations, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Without CloudTrail
      enabled, unauthorized or malicious activity might go undetected, leading to
      potential security breaches and data loss.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      service. 3. Verify that there is at least one trail configured for each region.
      4. Ensure that each trail is logging management events and is set to apply to
      all regions.
  - Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      service. 3. Create a new trail or edit an existing trail to apply to all regions.
      4. Enable logging of management events. 5. Save the changes to ensure CloudTrail
      is enabled and configured correctly across all regions.
