    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: By restricting public access to S3 buckets, you minimize the risk of
      unauthorized access and data leakage. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to access, modify, or delete data, leading to potential data loss
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and select each bucket.
    - Check the bucket permissions and access policies to ensure that public access
      is disabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is
      allowed.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket permissions if necessary.
