    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the public. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      this risk.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no public bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs)
      that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      they do not allow unauthorized access.
