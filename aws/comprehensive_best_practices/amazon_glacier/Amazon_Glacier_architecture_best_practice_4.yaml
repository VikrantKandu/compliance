    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      by requiring a second factor of authentication. Without MFA, if the root account
      password is compromised, an attacker can gain full control over the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users" and then "Security credentials."
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - Click on "Security credentials" and select "Activate MFA."
    - Follow the instructions to configure and activate MFA using a virtual MFA device,
      U2F security key, or other supported MFA device.
