    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates these risks by restricting access to authorized
      users only.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check ACL settings.
      6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any statements in the bucket policy that grant public access.
      2. Adjust the ACL to remove any public access permissions. 3. Use the AWS CLI
      or Management Console to apply these changes. 4. Enable S3 Block Public Access
      settings to prevent future public access configurations.
