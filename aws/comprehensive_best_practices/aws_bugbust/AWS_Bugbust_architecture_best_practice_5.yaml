    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that an IAM password policy is enabled and configured
      according to best practices. A strong password policy helps protect AWS resources
      by enforcing password complexity and rotation.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without a password policy, users may set weak passwords,
      making it easier for attackers to compromise accounts.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on Account settings.
    - Verify that a password policy is enabled and configured with at least the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of 8 characters.
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Password expiration period of 90 days or less.
      - Prevent password reuse.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on Account settings.
    - Enable and configure the password policy with the recommended settings.
