    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance the security
      of AWS accounts by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra layer of security for AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain
      full access to the account. MFA helps mitigate this risk by requiring a second
      form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA Enabled" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the steps to assign an MFA device to the user.
