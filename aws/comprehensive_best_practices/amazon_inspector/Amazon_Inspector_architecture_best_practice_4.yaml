    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to
      prevent unauthorized access. This involves ensuring that bucket policies and
      access control lists (ACLs) are set correctly to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of sensitive
      data being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public read or write access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
