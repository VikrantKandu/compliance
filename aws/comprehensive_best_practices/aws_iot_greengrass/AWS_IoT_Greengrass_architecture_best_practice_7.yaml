    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access permissions
      are granted.
