    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets ensures that the data
      stored is encrypted, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
      Without encryption, sensitive data may be exposed if unauthorized access occurs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," verify that server-side encryption is enabled and
      configured with either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," select "Edit."
    - Choose either "AES-256" or "AWS-KMS" for server-side encryption.
    - Save the changes to enable encryption on the bucket.
