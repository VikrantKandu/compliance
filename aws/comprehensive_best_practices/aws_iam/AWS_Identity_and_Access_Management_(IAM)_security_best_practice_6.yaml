    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      required. This ensures that sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed to the
      internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this
      risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public read
      or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
