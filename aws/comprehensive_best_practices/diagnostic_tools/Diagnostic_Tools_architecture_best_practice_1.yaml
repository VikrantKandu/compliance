    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access to avoid
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' setting is enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' on all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket configurations to ensure compliance.
