  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      required. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and the bucket policy.
    - Step 4: Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Step 5: Confirm that there are no bucket policies or ACLs allowing public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 5: Enable "Block all public access" to restrict public access.
    - Step 6: Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access
        is granted.
