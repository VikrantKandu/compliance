    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      by verifying the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs). Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the 'Access Control List' to ensure public access is not granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the Access Control List settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      and bucket levels.
