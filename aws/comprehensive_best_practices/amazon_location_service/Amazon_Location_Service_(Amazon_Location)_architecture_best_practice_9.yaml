    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate, which greatly enhances security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account helps prevent unauthorized access,
      even if the root account password is compromised. This is crucial as the root
      account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account, posing
      a significant security risk if compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to set up and activate MFA using a virtual MFA device, U2F
      security key, or other supported methods.
