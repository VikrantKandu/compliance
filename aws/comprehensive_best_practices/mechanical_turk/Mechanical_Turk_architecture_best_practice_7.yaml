    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and integrity. Unauthorized access can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with "Public" access status.
      4. For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs)
      to ensure they do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the bucket's policy
      status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console. 2. Update
      the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access. 3. Adjust
      the bucket's ACLs to ensure that only authorized users have access. 4. Consider
      using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
