    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are launched in a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
      to ensure network isolation and security. This helps control inbound and outbound
      traffic and provides additional layers of security.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in a VPC enhances security by isolating resources
      in a private network and enabling better control over network access. Without
      a VPC, instances may be exposed to potential security threats and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the list of running instances.
    - Verify that each instance is associated with a VPC.
    - Confirm that there are no instances running outside of a VPC.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC if no
      specific VPC is chosen.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any EC2 instances running outside of a VPC.
    - Plan and execute a migration strategy to launch or move these instances into
      a VPC.
    - Update any related security groups and network configurations to ensure continued
      functionality and security within the VPC.
