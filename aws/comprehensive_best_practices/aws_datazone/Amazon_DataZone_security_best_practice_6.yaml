  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires not
      only a password but also a second factor, such as a one-time code from a mobile
      device, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to access accounts.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is recommended because it significantly
      reduces the risk of compromised user credentials. Without MFA, an attacker with
      access to a user's password can gain full access to AWS resources, potentially
      leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the
      'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list the MFA devices and their associated
      users.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Click on the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Assigned MFA device', click on 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign and
      activate an MFA device for the user.
