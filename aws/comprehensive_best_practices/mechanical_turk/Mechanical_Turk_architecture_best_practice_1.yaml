  - Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      access to only authorized users and applications.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access to sensitive information, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks by restricting access to only
      those who need it.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI:
      - Run aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and verify that the ACL
        does not grant public access.
      - Run aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> and ensure the policy
        does not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to apply changes.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
