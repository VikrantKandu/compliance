    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      to prevent unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data
      exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data,
      leading to security incidents and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs to restrict public access.
