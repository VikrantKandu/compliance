    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
      It is crucial to restrict access to only authorized users and applications.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of data exposure and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions. 4. Check the "Access"
      column for any buckets marked as "Public". 5. For each bucket, click on the
      bucket name. 6. Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the "Block public access"
      settings and bucket policy. 7. Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting
      is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable
      the "Block all public access" setting. 5. Review and update the bucket policy
      to ensure it does not allow public access. 6. Save the changes and verify that
      the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
