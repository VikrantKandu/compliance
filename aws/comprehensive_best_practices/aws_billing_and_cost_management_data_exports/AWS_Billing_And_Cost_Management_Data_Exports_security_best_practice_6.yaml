    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational
      damage. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure public access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable any public access settings.
    - Enable the Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
