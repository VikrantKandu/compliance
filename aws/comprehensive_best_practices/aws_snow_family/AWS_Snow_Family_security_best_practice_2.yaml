    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for AWS accounts by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors
      to gain access. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to
      protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to potential
      data breaches and unauthorized actions within the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the MFA column.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
