    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to ensure
      data privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have "Public access" enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the
      ACL settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Disable "Public access" by removing any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
