    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      on top of usernames and passwords. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps to protect
      their AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA is recommended because it significantly reduces the risk
      of account compromise. Without MFA, if an account's credentials are leaked or
      stolen, unauthorized users can gain full access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is disabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)", choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
