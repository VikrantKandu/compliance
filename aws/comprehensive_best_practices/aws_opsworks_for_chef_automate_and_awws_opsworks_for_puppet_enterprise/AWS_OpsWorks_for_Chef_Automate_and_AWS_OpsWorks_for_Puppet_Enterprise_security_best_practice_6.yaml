    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can expose sensitive data and increase the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that no public access
      is granted.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not include statements allowing public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
