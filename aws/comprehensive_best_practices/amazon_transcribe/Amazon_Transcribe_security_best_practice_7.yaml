    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access to resources, making it significantly
      harder for unauthorized users to compromise the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is critical because it is the most
      privileged account in AWS. If compromised, it can lead to unauthorized access
      and potentially severe security breaches. MFA reduces the risk of account compromise
      by requiring an additional verification factor.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the 'root account' and check the 'MFA' column.
    - Verify that 'MFA' is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or
      hardware MFA device.
