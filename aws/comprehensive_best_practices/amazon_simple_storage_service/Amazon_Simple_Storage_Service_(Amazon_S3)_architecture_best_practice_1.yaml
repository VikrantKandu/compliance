    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are not using the default
      security group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Using specific
      security groups with restricted rules enhances security by limiting access.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to EC2 instances. This can lead to unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' and review the 'Security Groups' column for each instance.
    - Verify that none of the instances are associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the application needs.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the EC2 instance.
    - Associate the newly created security group with the EC2 instance.
