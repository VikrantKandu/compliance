    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate pieces of evidence to authenticate, which significantly
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because the root account
      has unrestricted access to all AWS resources and services. Without MFA, if the
      root account credentials are compromised, an attacker can potentially gain full
      control over the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account settings.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account settings.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA on the root account, choosing either a virtual
      MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
