    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Restricting access ensures that only authorized
      users can interact with the data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies to restrict public access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
