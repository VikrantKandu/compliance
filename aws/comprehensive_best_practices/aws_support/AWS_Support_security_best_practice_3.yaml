    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound access. Using custom security groups
      with specific rules enhances security.
    Rationale: Default security groups allow all inbound traffic, posing a security
      risk. Restricting inbound access minimizes the attack surface and enhances security
      posture.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the instance.
    - Attach the newly created security group to the instance.
