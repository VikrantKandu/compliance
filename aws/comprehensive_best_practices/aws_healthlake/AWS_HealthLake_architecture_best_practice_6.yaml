    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to
      present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to
      AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially if a password is compromised. Without MFA, user accounts are at higher
      risk of being accessed by malicious actors, potentially leading to data breaches
      or unauthorized modifications.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure all users have MFA enabled by repeating the process.
