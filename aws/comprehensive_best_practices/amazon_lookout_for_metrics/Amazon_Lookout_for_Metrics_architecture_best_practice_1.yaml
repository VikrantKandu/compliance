    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can
      lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data leakage,
      unauthorized access, and potential manipulation of data. Ensuring buckets are
      private mitigates these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket
      policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and access the S3 service. 2.
      Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on the "Permissions"
      tab and enable all "Block public access" settings. 4. Review and remove any
      bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access. 5. Save the changes to ensure
      the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
