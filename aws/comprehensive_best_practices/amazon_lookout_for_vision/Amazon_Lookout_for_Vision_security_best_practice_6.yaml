    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that each bucket's settings do not allow public access by default.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions and ensure that the "Block all public
      access" setting is enabled.
    - Update any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
