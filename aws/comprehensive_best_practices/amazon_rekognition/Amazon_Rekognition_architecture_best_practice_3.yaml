    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public protects against
      accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
