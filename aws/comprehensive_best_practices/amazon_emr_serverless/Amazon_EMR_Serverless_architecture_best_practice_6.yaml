    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to the data stored within them. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are private, you mitigate the risk of unauthorized
      data access, which could lead to data breaches and non-compliance with data
      protection regulations. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data
      to the internet, leading to significant security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Click on "Permissions" and ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Modify any bucket policies that allow public access to restrict access appropriately.
