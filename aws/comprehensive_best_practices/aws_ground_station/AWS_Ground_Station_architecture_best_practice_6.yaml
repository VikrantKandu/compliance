  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible by default helps in maintaining data confidentiality and
      integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings. 4. Verify that
      'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Review the bucket policy and access
      control list (ACL) to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Enable 'Block all public
      access' under the bucket's 'Block Public Access' settings. 5. Review and modify
      the bucket policy and ACL to remove any permissions that allow public access.
