  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can pose a security risk.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      and potentially harmful network traffic. Ensuring instances are attached to
      custom security groups with specific rules helps minimize exposure and enhances
      security.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that no instance is using the default
      security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Remediation: 1. Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound
      rules. 2. Detach the default security group from the EC2 instance. 3. Attach
      the newly created security group to the EC2 instance. 4. Ensure the new security
      group has rules that only allow necessary traffic.
