    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are set to private
      to prevent unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data
      leakage and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets are private, but misconfigurations can make
      them public. Public buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to security breaches
      and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - Confirm that the Access column indicates "Private" for all buckets.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not private.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and/or ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to enforce bucket privacy.
