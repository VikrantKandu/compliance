    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Enabled for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance
      the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a one-time
      password generated by a hardware or software token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials and prevents unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if user credentials are compromised, attackers
      can gain full access to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches
      and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts
      to assign an MFA device.
