    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead
      to sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets are private. However, if a bucket is configured
      to be publicly accessible, it can pose a significant security risk by exposing
      sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the "Access" column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the publicly accessible bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
