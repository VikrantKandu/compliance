    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from being exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can
      be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Save changes to apply the new permissions.
