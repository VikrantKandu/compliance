    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure compliance with security and operational standards.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can lead to security vulnerabilities, compliance
      issues, and operational inefficiencies. Approved AMIs are vetted for security,
      compatibility, and performance, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring
      consistency across deployments.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each running instance.
    - Compare the AMI IDs against the list of approved AMIs maintained by your organization.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched using any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan and execute a migration of these instances to approved AMIs.
    - Update organizational policies and automation scripts to ensure future instances
      are launched with approved AMIs only.
