  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access,
      providing an additional layer of security.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts, even if a user's password is compromised. Without MFA, attackers
      can easily gain access by exploiting weak or stolen passwords, leading to potential
      data breaches and unauthorized actions.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify MFA status for each
      user.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual
      or hardware MFA device to the user.
