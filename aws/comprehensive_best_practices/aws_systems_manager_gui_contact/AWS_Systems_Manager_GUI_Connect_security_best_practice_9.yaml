    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon
      Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches and performance
      improvements.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities and security
      risks that have been resolved in newer versions. Keeping AMIs up to date helps
      in maintaining the security and stability of the instances.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI in the region.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless explicitly
      updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate workloads to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance after successful migration.
