    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect sensitive data and
      maintain privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS Config or AWS CLI to check the public access settings for all S3 buckets
      in the account.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
