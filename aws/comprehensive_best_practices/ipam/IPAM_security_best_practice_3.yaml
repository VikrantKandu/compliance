    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet, leading to potential data leaks
      and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
