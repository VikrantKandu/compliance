  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to
      prevent public access. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private is crucial to protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. It is recommended to keep
      S3 buckets private unless explicitly required.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Verify that there are no bucket policies
      or access control lists (ACLs) that allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be changed
      to allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that requires remediation. 3. Navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
      4. Enable "Block all public access" to restrict public access. 5. Review and
      modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they do not permit public access.
