    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached only to groups or roles to ensure
      that permissions are managed centrally and consistently. Directly attaching
      policies to individual users can lead to complex permission management and potential
      security risks.
    Rationale: Attaching policies to groups or roles rather than individual users
      simplifies permission management and reduces the risk of over-privileged users.
      It ensures that permissions can be managed centrally, making it easier to audit,
      review, and update permissions as needed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the list of policies and identify any that are attached directly to users.
    - Verify that all policies are attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, AWS IAM allows policies to be attached to users, groups,
      and roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies that are directly attached to users.
    - Create or identify appropriate groups or roles for the policies.
    - Attach the policies to these groups or roles.
    - Add users to the appropriate groups or assign them to the roles to inherit the
      necessary permissions.
