  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. Public access should be restricted
      to prevent data breaches and comply with privacy regulations.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being
      exposed to unauthorized users. This can result in data breaches, legal implications,
      and damage to the organization's reputation.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME
      to check the ACL settings for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Edit" under "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save the changes.
    - Review bucket policies and remove any statements that allow public access.
