  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and ACL do not allow public access. 5. Verify that the "Block Public
      Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Review the bucket policy and ACL,
      and remove any statements that allow public access. 4. Enable the "Block Public
      Access" settings for the bucket. 5. Save the changes and verify that the bucket
      is no longer publicly accessible.
