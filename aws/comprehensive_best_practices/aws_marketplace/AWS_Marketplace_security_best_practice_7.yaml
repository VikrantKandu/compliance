    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets prevents unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks, financial
      loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the "Access" column for each bucket to ensure it is not marked as "Public".
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket's ACL for public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove the public access permissions
      from the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket permissions and disable
      public access.
    - Implement bucket policies and block public access settings to prevent future
      public access configurations.
