    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access (bucket settings)" section to ensure that all
      options are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) that
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
