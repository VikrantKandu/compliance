    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual
      Private Cloud (VPC). Launching instances within a VPC provides enhanced security
      features such as network isolation and security groups.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC allows for better control over
      network traffic and security configurations, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access or data breaches. Instances outside of a VPC may be exposed to the public
      internet without sufficient protection.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Review the list of running instances and verify that each instance is associated
      with a VPC.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the 'VpcId' attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances should be launched within a VPC if the
      account was created after December 4, 2013.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances not within a VPC.
    - Plan and execute the migration of these instances to a VPC, ensuring minimal
      downtime and data integrity.
    - Update any associated configurations such as security groups, route tables,
      and network ACLs to align with VPC best practices.
