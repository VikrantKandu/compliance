    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can
      lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access settings enabled, such as allowing 'Everyone'
      or 'Any authenticated AWS user' access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
