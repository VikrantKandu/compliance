    Title: Enable Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for all EC2 instances
      to provide more granular metrics and better insights into instance performance.
    Rationale: Detailed monitoring offers more frequent data points than basic monitoring,
      allowing for more precise tracking of instance performance and resource utilization.
      This can help in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing resource
      allocation. Without detailed monitoring, you may miss critical performance issues
      that could lead to service degradation or outages.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the Monitoring column to verify if detailed monitoring
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the Monitoring attribute in the response for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched with basic monitoring enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select the instance for which you want to enable detailed monitoring.
    - Click on the Actions dropdown, select Monitor and troubleshoot, and then Enable
      detailed monitoring.
    - Confirm the action to enable detailed monitoring for the instance.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids
      <instance-id> to enable detailed monitoring for specific instances.
