    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private by default mitigates the risk of data
      exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket policies or access control
      lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible when created.
    Remediation:
    - Update bucket policies to remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify ACLs to ensure that no public access is granted.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
