    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Review bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings to confirm no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
