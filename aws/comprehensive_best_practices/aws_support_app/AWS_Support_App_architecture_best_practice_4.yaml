    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets may lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to safeguard sensitive
      data from unauthorized access or data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by attackers to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to inspect.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Regularly review and update the bucket's permissions to ensure compliance.
