    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure if sensitive information
      is stored in them. It is vital to restrict access to only authorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in unauthorized access to
      sensitive data, leading to data breaches and potential non-compliance with data
      protection regulations. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
