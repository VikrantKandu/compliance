    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that no S3 buckets are publicly accessible, which
      could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be restricted unless absolutely necessary.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leakage. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive
      information and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust IAM policies to ensure no unintended public access is granted.
