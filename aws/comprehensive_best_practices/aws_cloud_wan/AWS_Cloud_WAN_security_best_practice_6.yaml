    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Regularly update Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for EC2 instances to
      ensure they include the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in later versions. Regular updates are crucial for maintaining
      security and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that the AMI ID corresponds to the latest version available.
    Default Value: Instances may use any AMI, including older versions.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the latest AMI for your operating system and application stack.
    - Plan and execute an update of the AMI for each instance, ensuring compatibility
      and minimal downtime.
    - Regularly schedule reviews and updates of AMIs used by EC2 instances.
