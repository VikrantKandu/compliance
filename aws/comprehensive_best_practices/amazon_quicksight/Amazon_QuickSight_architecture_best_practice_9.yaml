    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet. This can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and
      reputational damage. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check the bucket policy for any statements allowing public access.
    - Verify the settings in the "Block Public Access" configuration to ensure public
      access is restricted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly granted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Configure the "Block Public Access" settings to block all public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Test the bucket to ensure it is not accessible from the internet.
