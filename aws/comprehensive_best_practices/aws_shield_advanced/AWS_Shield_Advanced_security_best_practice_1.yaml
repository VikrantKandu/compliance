    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks. Public access allows anyone on
      the internet to view or modify the contents of your S3 buckets, which can lead
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the public. This can lead to data breaches,
      compliance violations, and reputational damage. By ensuring S3 buckets are not
      publicly accessible, you mitigate these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - In the S3 dashboard, review the list of buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public access" column to ensure it is set to "Not
      public".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and ensure there are no public grants listed in the output.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly set otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click "Block public access".
    - Enable all options to block public access and save changes.
    - Review and remove any public access policies or bucket ACLs that grant public
      access.
