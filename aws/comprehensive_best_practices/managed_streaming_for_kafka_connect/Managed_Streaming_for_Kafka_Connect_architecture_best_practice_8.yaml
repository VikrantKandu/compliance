    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment. It requires users to provide a second form of authentication,
      which helps protect against compromised passwords.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS accounts by requiring
      a second form of verification. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the account, leading to potential data
      breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on a user for whom MFA needs to be enabled.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
