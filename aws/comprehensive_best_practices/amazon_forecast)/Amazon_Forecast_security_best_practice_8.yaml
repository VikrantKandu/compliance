  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leakage. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive data and
      maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs
      allow public access. 4. Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket policies and check
      for any statements granting public access. 5. Verify the bucket's Block Public
      Access settings are enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review and remove
      any public access permissions. 2. Enable Block Public Access settings for the
      bucket. 3. Update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
