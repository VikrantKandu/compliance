    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all S3 buckets have versioning enabled to protect against
      accidental or malicious data deletion.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning in S3 buckets allows for the recovery of objects
      that are accidentally deleted or overwritten. Without versioning, data loss
      could occur, leading to potential business disruption and loss of critical information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the Properties tab.
    - Verify that Versioning is set to Enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have versioning enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, select the Properties tab.
    - Enable versioning by selecting the Versioning option and choosing Enable.
