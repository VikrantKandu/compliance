    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions"
        tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations can be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Go to the "Permissions" tab and modify the bucket policy and ACL to
        restrict public access.
    - Step 5: Use the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
