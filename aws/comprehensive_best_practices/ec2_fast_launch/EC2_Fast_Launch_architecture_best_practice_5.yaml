  - ID: AWS-001
  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources. Enabling MFA
      for all IAM users helps protect their AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Without MFA, a compromised password could allow an attacker to gain
      full access to an AWS account. MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring an additional verification factor.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify that MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Choose the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device". 7.
      Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
