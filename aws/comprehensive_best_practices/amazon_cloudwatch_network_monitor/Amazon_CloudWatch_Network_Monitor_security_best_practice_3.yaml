    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access due to compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, a malicious actor who gains
      access to a user's credentials can easily exploit AWS resources, leading to
      potential data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that each user has
      an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for which
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7.
      Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
