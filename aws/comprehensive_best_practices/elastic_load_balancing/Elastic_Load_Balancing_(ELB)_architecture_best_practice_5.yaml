    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data theft, or data modification. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of accidental data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to run aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and check
      for public grants.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
