    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy allows public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and edit the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
