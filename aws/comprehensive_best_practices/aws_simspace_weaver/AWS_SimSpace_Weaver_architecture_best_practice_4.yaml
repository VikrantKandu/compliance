    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Not Using the Default Security Group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound access, which
      can expose instances to various security threats.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches, as it allows all inbound traffic by default. Properly
      configured security groups help to restrict access and minimize security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Ensure that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the association with the default security group.
