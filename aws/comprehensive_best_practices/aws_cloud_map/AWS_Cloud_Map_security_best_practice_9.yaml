  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets may expose sensitive information to
      the internet, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
      Restricting access to necessary users and applications minimizes these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no buckets have public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      for any statements allowing public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket ACL to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket policy to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to apply these changes and verify
      that public access is disabled.
