    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. This ensures that sensitive data is not exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
