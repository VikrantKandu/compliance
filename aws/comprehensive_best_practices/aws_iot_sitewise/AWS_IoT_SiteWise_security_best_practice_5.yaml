    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to enter a unique authentication
      code from a hardware or virtual MFA device in addition to their password. This
      helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to password theft or exposure. Without MFA, an attacker who gains
      access to a user's password can easily access AWS resources, potentially leading
      to data breaches or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user to configure.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
