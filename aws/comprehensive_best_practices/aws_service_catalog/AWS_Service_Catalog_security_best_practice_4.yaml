    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that "Block all public access"
      is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
