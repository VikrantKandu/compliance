    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to their accounts. MFA requires users
      to provide a second form of authentication beyond just a password, making unauthorized
      access more difficult.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to password theft or guessing attacks. Without MFA, an attacker
      who gains access to an IAM user's password can easily access AWS resources,
      potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized changes.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and review each user's security credentials.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the 'MFA Device' column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users.'
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and select 'Manage MFA device.'
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
