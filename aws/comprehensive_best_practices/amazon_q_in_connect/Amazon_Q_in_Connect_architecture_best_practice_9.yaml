    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data leaks and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure all options
      are enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm there are
      no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and block public access unless
      explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public permissions.
