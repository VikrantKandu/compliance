    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of verification
      in addition to their password. This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      leading to unauthorized access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA significantly
      enhances security by requiring an additional verification factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the Security credentials
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled and compare it with the list of all users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - On the Security credentials tab, choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure the user completes the MFA setup process.
