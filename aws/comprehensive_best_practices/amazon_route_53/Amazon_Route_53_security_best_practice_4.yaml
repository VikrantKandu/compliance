    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in an AWS account. MFA adds an additional layer of security
      by requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the
      user has on them, i.e., a device that generates a time-sensitive passcode.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. If an attacker gains access to an IAM user's password, they would
      still require the MFA device to access AWS resources, thereby enhancing the
      security of the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA' is enabled by reviewing the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users' and select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab and then 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
