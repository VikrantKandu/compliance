    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance account security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of your username and password by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts and resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead
      to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click on 'Manage' and follow the steps
      to activate MFA for the user.
