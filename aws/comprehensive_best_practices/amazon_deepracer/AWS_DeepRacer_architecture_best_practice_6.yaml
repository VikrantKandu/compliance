    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled. Encryption at rest protects the data stored in S3 from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets ensures that data is protected even
      if unauthorized access occurs. Without encryption, sensitive data may be exposed,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that "Default encryption" is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
        <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Properties" tab and then "Default encryption".
    - Select "Enable" and choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
