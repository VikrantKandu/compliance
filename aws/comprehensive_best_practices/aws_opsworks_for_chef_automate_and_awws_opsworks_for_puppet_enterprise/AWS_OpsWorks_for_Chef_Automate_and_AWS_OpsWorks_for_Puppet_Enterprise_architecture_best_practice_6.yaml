    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users but are instead attached to groups or roles. This approach
      simplifies policy management and enhances security.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex and difficult-to-manage
      permission structures. By attaching policies to groups or roles, it becomes
      easier to manage and audit permissions, reducing the risk of excessive or unintended
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the list of users and review their attached policies.
    - Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles instead of individual users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Identify users with directly attached policies.
    - Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles.
    - Attach the policies to these groups or roles.
    - Remove the direct policy attachment from individual users.
