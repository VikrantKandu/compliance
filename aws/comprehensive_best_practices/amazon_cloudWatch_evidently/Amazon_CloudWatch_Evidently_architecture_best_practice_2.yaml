    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. Public access can
      lead to sensitive information being accessed or modified by malicious actors.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Check the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to ensure that they do not allow public access.
      5. Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' and 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy'
      to verify permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs remediation. 4. Edit the bucket policy and access
      control list (ACL) to remove any public access settings. 5. Enable bucket settings
      to block all public access if not needed. 6. Use the AWS CLI to update bucket
      policies and ACLs as needed to remove public access.
