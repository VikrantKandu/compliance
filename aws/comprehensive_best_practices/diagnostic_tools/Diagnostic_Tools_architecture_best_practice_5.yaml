    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      unauthorized public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      public access helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL)
      settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Trusted Advisor or S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public
      access.
