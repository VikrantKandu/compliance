    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to present two or more separate forms of identification before
      accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, a compromised password could allow an attacker
      to gain access to sensitive resources and data. MFA adds an extra layer of security,
      making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left pane, select "Users" to view the list of IAM users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, select "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA
      device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
