    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private reduces
      the risk of data breaches and helps maintain data confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of buckets and check the access permissions for each
        bucket.
    - Step 4: Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Go to the permissions tab and disable public access settings.
    - Step 5: Save the changes to ensure the bucket is private.
