    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of verification, which
      helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps reduce the risk of compromised credentials
      by requiring an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, user accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches
      and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, verify that an MFA device is assigned by checking the MFA column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with assigned MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
