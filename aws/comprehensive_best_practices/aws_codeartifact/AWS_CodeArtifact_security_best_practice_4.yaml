  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group of a VPC. Using the default security group can lead to
      unintended open access to instances, as it allows all inbound and outbound traffic
      by default.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk because it permits
      unrestricted access to EC2 instances. This can lead to unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches. It is recommended to use custom security groups with
      specific inbound and outbound rules tailored to the application requirements.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, check the 'Security
      Groups' column. 5. Verify that no instance is associated with a security group
      named 'default'.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules that align with
      your security requirements. 3. Detach the default security group from the instances
      and attach the newly created security group.
