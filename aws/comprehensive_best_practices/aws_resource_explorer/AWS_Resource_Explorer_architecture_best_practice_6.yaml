    Title: Ensure IAM users have MFA enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk
      of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the account. Implementing MFA significantly
      reduces this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list users and
      aws iam get-user to check MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, click on the user name.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
    - Ensure all users have MFA enabled to comply with this best practice.
