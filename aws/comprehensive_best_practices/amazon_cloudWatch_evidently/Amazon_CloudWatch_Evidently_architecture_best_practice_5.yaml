    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication beyond just a
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      activities and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select Users.
    - Review each user to verify that MFA is enabled. This can be identified by checking
      the 'MFA Device' column for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate and configure MFA for the user.
