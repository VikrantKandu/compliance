    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to configure access
      policies properly to protect sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible minimizes
      the risk of exposing sensitive information to unintended users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to review.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access" setting
      is enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm that they
      do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have "Block all public access" enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" on the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best practices.
