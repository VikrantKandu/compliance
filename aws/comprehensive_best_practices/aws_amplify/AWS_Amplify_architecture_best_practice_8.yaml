  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of data exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the public access settings are
      set to block all public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing it in
      the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, immediately update the bucket's
      permissions to block public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket's public access settings
      or use the AWS CLI to apply aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket <bucket-name>
      --public-access-block-configuration BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
