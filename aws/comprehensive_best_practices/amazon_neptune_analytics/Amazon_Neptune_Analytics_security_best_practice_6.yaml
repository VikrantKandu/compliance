    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of data breaches and
      complies with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
        <bucket-name> and verify that the IsPublic attribute is false.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Re-evaluate any business needs for public access and implement stricter controls
      if necessary.
