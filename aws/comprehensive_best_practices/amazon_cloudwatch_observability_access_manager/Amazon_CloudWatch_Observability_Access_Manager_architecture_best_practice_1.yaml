    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with default
      security groups. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound access,
      which can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to unintended exposure of services
      and data. Custom security groups with specific rules should be used to restrict
      access and minimize potential security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using a default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may use the default security group
      unless explicitly specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using default security groups.
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance's needs.
    - Associate the new custom security group with the instance.
    - Remove the default security group association from the instance.
