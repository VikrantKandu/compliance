    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by
      requiring additional verification beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users protects against unauthorized access to
      AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, compromised passwords can lead to unauthorized
      access, data breaches, and potential misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify whether MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - Select a user and click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', click 'Manage' and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA.
    - Repeat the process for all IAM users lacking MFA.
