    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it allows unrestricted access. It is recommended to use custom security
      groups with specific rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select Instances from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Ensure that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group if
      no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Assign the new security group to the EC2 instance.
    - Remove the default security group from the instance.
