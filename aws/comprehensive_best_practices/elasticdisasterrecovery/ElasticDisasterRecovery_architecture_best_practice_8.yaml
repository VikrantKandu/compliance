    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of protection on top of a username and password, reducing the risk of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's password could
      gain full access to the account, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized
      resource usage, and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on each user to view their details.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and assign an MFA device for the user.
