    Title: Enable Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for all EC2 instances
      to provide more granular metrics for performance analysis and troubleshooting.
    Rationale: Detailed monitoring provides data at 1-minute intervals, allowing for
      more accurate and timely insights into instance performance. Without detailed
      monitoring, only 5-minute interval data is available, which may not be sufficient
      for precise analysis and can lead to delayed detection of issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the instances you want to check.
    - Verify that the "Monitoring" column shows "Enabled" for detailed monitoring.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the Monitoring state for each instance.
    Default Value: Basic monitoring is enabled by default, providing metrics at 5-minute
      intervals.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select the instance(s) for which you want to enable detailed monitoring.
    - Click on "Actions," then "Monitor and troubleshoot," and select "Enable detailed
      monitoring."
    - Confirm the selection to apply detailed monitoring.
