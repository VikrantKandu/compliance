    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches. It is crucial to restrict access to only those who need it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access helps
      protect against unauthorized data access and potential security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public
      access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings.
    - Verify that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
