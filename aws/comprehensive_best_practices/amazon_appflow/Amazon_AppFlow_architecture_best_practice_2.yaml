    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires a second form
      of authentication, enhancing protection against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      account compromise. If MFA is not enabled, unauthorized users who obtain the
      root account credentials can gain full access to the AWS environment, leading
      to potential data breaches or resource mismanagement.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for the root account to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the steps to enable a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device for the
      root account.
