    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
