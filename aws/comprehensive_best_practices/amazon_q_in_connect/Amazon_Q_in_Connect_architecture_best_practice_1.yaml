    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles instead of directly
      to users to simplify management and improve security. This practice helps in
      managing permissions efficiently and reduces the risk of excessive permissions.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures and increase the risk of granting excessive permissions. By using
      groups or roles, permissions are easier to manage and audit, ensuring that users
      have only the permissions they need.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Examine the list of IAM policies and check if any are directly attached to users.
    - Verify that policies are attached only to groups or roles.
    Default Value: IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Identify IAM policies directly attached to users.
    - Detach these policies from users.
    - Attach the necessary policies to appropriate groups or roles.
    - Add users to the groups or assign roles as needed.
