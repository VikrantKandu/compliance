    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to sensitive data being exposed to the internet, posing security risks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Save the changes to apply the updated permissions.
