    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users adds
      an additional layer of security by requiring not only a password but also a
      second form of verification.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      even if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if an MFA device
      is assigned.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, click on Manage MFA Device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device.
