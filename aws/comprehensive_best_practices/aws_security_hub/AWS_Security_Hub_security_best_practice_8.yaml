  - Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled. Encryption protects data at rest by converting it into a secure format
      that is unreadable without a decryption key.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption for S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable
      to exposure if access controls are misconfigured or compromised.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the properties to see if default encryption is enabled.
      4. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> and verify that the server-side encryption configuration is present.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is not encrypted. 4. Go to the properties tab and
      enable default encryption. 5. Choose an encryption method, such as AES-256 or
      AWS-KMS.
