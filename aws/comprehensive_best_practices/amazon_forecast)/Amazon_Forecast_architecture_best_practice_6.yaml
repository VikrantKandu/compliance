    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      to prevent data leaks and maintain privacy.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access minimizes the risk
      of data exposure and strengthens the security posture of your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access if necessary.
