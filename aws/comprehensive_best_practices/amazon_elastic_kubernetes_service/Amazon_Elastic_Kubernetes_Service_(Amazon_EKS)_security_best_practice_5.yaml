  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are encrypted to protect
      sensitive data at rest. Encryption should be enabled on all S3 buckets to prevent
      unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect it from unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in S3 buckets
      could be exposed if accessed by unauthorized users.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the properties to verify that default encryption is
      enabled. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to confirm encryption settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the bucket properties and enable default encryption.
      4. Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
