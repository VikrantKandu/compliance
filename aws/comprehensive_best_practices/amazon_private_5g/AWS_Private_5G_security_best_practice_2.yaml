    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and security
      incidents. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to verify bucket ACLs and bucket policies for public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to remove
      any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users and services only.
