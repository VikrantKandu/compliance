    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      when logging into AWS environments. By requiring a second form of authentication,
      MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials, as it requires
      an additional verification step. Without MFA, attackers with access to user
      credentials can potentially gain full access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each IAM user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, click on "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
