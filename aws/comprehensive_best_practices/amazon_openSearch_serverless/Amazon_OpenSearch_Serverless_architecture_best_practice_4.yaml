    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive data and complies
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' on the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the access control list (ACL) to restrict access to specific users or
      roles.
