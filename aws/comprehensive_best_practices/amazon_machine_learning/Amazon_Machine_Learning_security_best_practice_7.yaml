    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound and
      outbound traffic, which poses a security risk.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to unintended open access to
      EC2 instances, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that the security group is not the default one.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise during instance creation.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your needs.
    - Disassociate the EC2 instance from the default security group.
    - Associate the instance with the newly created security group.
