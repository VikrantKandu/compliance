    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have versioning enabled to
      protect against accidental deletions or overwrites.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps in recovering from unintended
      user actions and application failures. It provides an additional layer of data
      protection by keeping multiple versions of an object.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and choose the "Properties" tab.
    - Check if the "Versioning" status is set to "Enabled".
    - Repeat for all buckets in your account.
    Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default on S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket where you want to enable versioning.
    - Choose the "Properties" tab and click on "Versioning".
    - Select "Enable" and save the changes.
