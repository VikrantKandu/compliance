  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can expose instances to potential security threats. Custom security groups should
      be used to define specific inbound and outbound rules based on the instance's
      role and requirements.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      EC2 instances to the internet or other network segments. This increases the
      risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Defining custom security
      groups helps to enforce the principle of least privilege and limits network
      access to only what is necessary.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that no instance is associated with the
      default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may use the default security group if
      no other group is specified.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored to the
      instance's role. 3. Associate the new security group with the instance. 4. Remove
      the association of the default security group from the instance.
