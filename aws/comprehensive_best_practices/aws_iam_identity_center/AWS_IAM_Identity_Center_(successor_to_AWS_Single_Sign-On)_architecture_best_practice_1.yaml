    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that no bucket is configured to allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy or access control list (ACL) to restrict public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
