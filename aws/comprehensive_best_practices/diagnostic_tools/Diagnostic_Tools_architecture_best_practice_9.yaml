    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are launched using the latest
      Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches and
      features.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in more recent versions. Regularly updating AMIs helps maintain
      security and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that the AMI ID corresponds to the latest version available from the
      AMI provider.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified
      at launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the latest AMI ID from the AMI provider.
    - Stop the instance if necessary.
    - Launch a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Terminate the old instance if it is no longer needed.
