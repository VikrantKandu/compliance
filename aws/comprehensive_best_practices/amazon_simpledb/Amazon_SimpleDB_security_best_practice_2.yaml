    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires users
      to provide two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access,
      making unauthorized access more difficult.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches, resulting in financial and reputational
      damage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the Security
      credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that all users have MFA
      devices assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      authentication section, choose Manage. 7. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA
      device to the user.
