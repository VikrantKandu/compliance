    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as anyone
      on the internet can access the data stored in them. Restricting access helps
      protect sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) grant
        public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Go to the S3 console and select the bucket.
    - Action 2: Enable 'Block all public access' in the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Action 3: Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they do not
        grant public access.
