    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing
      the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and credential
      theft, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit: To verify compliance, list all IAM users and check the MFA status for each
      user. Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list users, and aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each user to verify MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: To remediate, enable MFA for all IAM users by navigating to the IAM
      console, selecting each user, and configuring an MFA device such as a virtual
      MFA app or a hardware key.
