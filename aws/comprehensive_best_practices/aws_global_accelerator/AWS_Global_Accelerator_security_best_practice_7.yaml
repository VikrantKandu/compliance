    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
      Approved AMIs are those that have been vetted for security vulnerabilities and
      compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Using unapproved or outdated AMIs can expose instances to known vulnerabilities
      and non-compliance with organizational policies. Ensuring the use of approved
      AMIs helps maintain a secure and compliant infrastructure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by your
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Create an AMI from a compliant instance or update the existing AMI to meet compliance
      standards.
    - Launch new instances using the approved AMI and migrate workloads from non-compliant
      instances.
    - Terminate non-compliant instances after successful migration.
