    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. It is important to
      restrict public access to prevent sensitive data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the bucket's public
      access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings.
    - Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
