    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, which
      could lead to data leaks or misuse of information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings for each bucket and ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust any Access Control Lists (ACLs) that may grant public access.
