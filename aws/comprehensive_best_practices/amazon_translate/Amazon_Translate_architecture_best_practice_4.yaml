    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data stored in the cloud. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure
      and potential data breaches, impacting the organization's security posture.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the Block Public Access feature for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
