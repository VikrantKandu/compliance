  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS accounts to enhance security. MFA requires users to provide an additional
      verification factor, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to access
      accounts.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring not only
      a password and username but also something that only the user has access to,
      such as a physical token or a mobile app. This reduces the risk of account compromise
      due to stolen credentials.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Under "Users", check each user account for the presence of an MFA device.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account by checking the "Security Status"
      on the IAM Dashboard.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for AWS accounts.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select "Users".
    - For each user, click on "Security credentials" and follow the steps to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Ensure the root account has MFA enabled by going to the "Security Status" section
      on the IAM Dashboard and following the instructions to enable MFA.
