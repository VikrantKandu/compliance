  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
  - Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are created with a secure
      and standardized configuration, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring
      compliance with organizational policies.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select Instances from the sidebar.
    - Review the AMI ID for each instance and verify it against the list of approved
      AMIs.
  - Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched using any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
  - Remediation:
    - Identify instances that are not using approved AMIs.
    - Create a snapshot of the current instance state if needed.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate data and configurations from the non-compliant instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance once the migration is complete.
