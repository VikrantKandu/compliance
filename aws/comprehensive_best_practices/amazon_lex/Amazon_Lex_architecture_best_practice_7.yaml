    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional
      layer of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms
      of identification before gaining access to resources, significantly reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial as it adds an extra layer of
      security beyond just a password. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      unauthorized access to AWS resources could occur, leading to potential data
      breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to see if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and click on "Users."
    - Select a user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage" and follow the prompts
      to assign an MFA device.
    - Repeat for all users without MFA enabled.
