    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the protection of
      AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to AWS resources. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security, making it more difficult for attackers to gain access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user to review their
      security settings. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled for each user under 'Security
      Credentials'.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose 'Security Credentials' and then 'Manage
      MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
