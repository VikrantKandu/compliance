    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access permissions enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Disable public access by adjusting the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove any public access policies: aws s3api delete-bucket-policy
        --bucket <bucket-name>.
