    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access permissions enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and access control
      lists (ACLs) to verify they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not have public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable public access settings and remove any public bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is private.
