  - Title: Ensure IAM Policies Are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users, but instead are attached to groups or roles. This practice
      promotes better security management and policy enforcement.
  - Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to difficulties in managing
      permissions and increases the risk of excessive permissions. By using groups
      or roles, permissions can be managed collectively and more efficiently, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Check the list of IAM users and inspect the policies attached. 4. Verify
      that no policies are directly attached to individual users. 5. Ensure that policies
      are attached to groups or roles instead.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached directly to users, groups,
      or roles.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify IAM users with directly attached policies. 2. Detach
      the policies from individual users. 3. Create or use existing IAM groups or
      roles. 4. Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles. 5. Add the
      users to the appropriate groups or assign the necessary roles.
