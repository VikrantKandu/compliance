    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security by requiring two forms of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security to the AWS
      environment. It reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used maliciously,
      as an attacker would also need access to the second factor device.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and review each user account.
    - Check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab and click on "Manage" under the "Assigned
      MFA device".
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
