  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      their contents. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions and access control
      list (ACL) settings. 5. Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public
      access. 6. Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Update the bucket policy
      to remove any public access permissions. 5. Enable "Block all public access"
      in the bucket settings. 6. Review and adjust the bucket's ACL to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
