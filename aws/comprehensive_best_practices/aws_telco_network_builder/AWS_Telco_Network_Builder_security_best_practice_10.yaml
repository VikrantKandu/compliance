    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches, as unauthorized users
      may access sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have no public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings in S3 to prevent public access.
