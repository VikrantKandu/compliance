    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and compromise
      the security of your data.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to review the ACL settings
      for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by running aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket ACL and policy to remove public access
      permissions.
