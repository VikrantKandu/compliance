    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not public reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and view the permissions tab. 4. Check the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted. 5. Use
      the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy to remove any public access permissions. 2. Adjust the ACL to ensure
      no public access is granted. 3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the
      bucket. 4. Re-evaluate the necessity of any public access requirements and apply
      the principle of least privilege.
