    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      AWS resources by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Rationale: Without MFA, unauthorized users who obtain credentials can gain access
      to AWS resources. Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled by verifying the "MFA" column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage."
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
