    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access can be inadvertently
      granted through bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs), leading to potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to safeguard sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to exfiltrate or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policies and ACLs for any public access permissions.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket configurations to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
