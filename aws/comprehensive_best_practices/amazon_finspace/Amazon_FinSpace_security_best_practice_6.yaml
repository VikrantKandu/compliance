    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for data security.
      Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access,
      modify, or delete sensitive information, leading to data loss, data breaches,
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no public access policies or ACLs associated with the
      bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Remove any public access policies or ACLs associated with the bucket.
