    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to provide
      an additional layer of security for accessing AWS resources. Enabling MFA helps
      protect user credentials from being compromised.
    Rationale: MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to phishing
      attacks and credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and check their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Click on each user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, select 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
