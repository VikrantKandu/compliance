    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions to ensure that there are no public access permissions
      set.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and ensure no public access configurations.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket to verify they are
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Review and remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is secured.
