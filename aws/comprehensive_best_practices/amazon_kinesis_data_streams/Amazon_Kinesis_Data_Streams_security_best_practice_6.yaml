    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security to user sign-in processes.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources by requiring
      an additional authentication factor beyond just a password. This reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access, especially if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column in the
      user list.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
