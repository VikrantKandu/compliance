    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users mitigates the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions and potentially sensitive
      data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to list users and
        aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to check MFA status for each
        user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security Credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor Authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate the MFA device for
      the user.
