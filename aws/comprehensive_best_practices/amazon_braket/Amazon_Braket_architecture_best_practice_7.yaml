  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps protect your data
      by encrypting it on AWS servers before storing it and decrypting it when you
      download the objects.
  - Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized access and may lead
      to data leaks or compliance issues.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
      service. 3. Select a bucket from the list. 4. Go to the Properties tab. 5. Check
      the Default encryption section to ensure that server-side encryption is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon
      S3 service. 3. Select the bucket that does not have encryption enabled. 4. Go
      to the Properties tab. 5. Under the Default encryption section, choose Enable.
      6. Select the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS). 7. Save
      the changes to enable server-side encryption for the bucket.
