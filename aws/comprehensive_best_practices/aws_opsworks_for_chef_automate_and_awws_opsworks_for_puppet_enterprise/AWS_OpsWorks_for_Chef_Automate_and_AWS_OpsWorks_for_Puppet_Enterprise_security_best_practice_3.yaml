    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have default encryption enabled
      to protect data at rest. Encryption helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data by ensuring that data is only accessible by users with the proper decryption
      keys.
    Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 can be vulnerable
      to data breaches and unauthorized access, especially if access controls are
      misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that "Default encryption" is
      enabled.
    - Verify that the encryption method (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS) is set as per organizational
      policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not encrypted.
    - Go to the properties of the bucket.
    - Enable "Default encryption" and select the desired encryption method.
    - Save changes to ensure that all new objects in the bucket are encrypted by default.
