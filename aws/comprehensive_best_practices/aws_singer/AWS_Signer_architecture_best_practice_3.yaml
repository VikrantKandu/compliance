    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that all buckets
      have the "Block all public access" setting enabled. 5. Verify that there are
      no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs remediation. 4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
      5. Enable the "Block all public access" setting. 6. Review and update any bucket
      policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
