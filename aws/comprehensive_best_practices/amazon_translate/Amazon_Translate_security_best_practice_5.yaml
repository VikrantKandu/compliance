    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data confidentiality and integrity. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data or allow unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps maintain data security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the 'Block public access' settings are enabled.
    - Ensure no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically update bucket settings to restrict
      public access.
