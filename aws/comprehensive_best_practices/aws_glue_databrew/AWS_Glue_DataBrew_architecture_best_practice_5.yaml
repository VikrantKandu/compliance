  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS accounts. Enabling MFA ensures that even if a password is
      compromised, unauthorized access is prevented without the additional authentication
      factor.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      which can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and other security incidents.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks or credential
      theft.
  - Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all IAM users and verify
      that MFA is enabled for each user. In the AWS Console, navigate to IAM > Users
      and check the 'MFA' column for each user. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>
      to verify MFA status.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: To enable MFA, log into the AWS Management Console, go to IAM > Users,
      select the user, and choose 'Manage MFA device'. Follow the steps to assign
      a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device to the user.
