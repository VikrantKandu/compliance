    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification step
      during the login process.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account adds an extra layer of security, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, the root account is more vulnerable
      to attacks, which could lead to compromised resources and data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the security status section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
