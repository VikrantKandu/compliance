    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data breaches
      and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to adjust the settings.
    - Implement IAM policies to control access to the bucket.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or specific buckets.
