    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and compliance issues. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that 'Block public access' settings are enabled.
    - Ensure there are no public access policies in the bucket policy or access control
      list (ACL).
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the permissions tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and remove any public access policies from the bucket policy and ACL.
