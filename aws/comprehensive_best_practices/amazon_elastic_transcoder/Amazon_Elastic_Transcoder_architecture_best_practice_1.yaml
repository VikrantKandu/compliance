  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to sensitive data leakage.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      minimizes these risks and helps maintain data confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that "Block all public
      access" is enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public (everyone)
      access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all
      public access." 5. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that allow
      public access to ensure they do not grant public permissions.
