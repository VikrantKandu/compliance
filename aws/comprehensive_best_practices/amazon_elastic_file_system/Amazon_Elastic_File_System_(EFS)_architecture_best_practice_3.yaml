    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access settings
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not grant public access.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
