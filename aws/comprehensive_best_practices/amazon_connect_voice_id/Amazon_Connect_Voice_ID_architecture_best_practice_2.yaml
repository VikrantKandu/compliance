    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized public access. S3 buckets should be set with appropriate
      policies and permissions to restrict access to authorized users only.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column to verify if any buckets
      are listed as public.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to
      ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
