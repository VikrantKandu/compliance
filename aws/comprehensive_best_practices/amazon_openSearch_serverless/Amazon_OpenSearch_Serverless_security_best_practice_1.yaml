  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized data access. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions tab. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public access. 5. Use AWS
      CLI or SDKs to run aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify that the policy status is not public.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not granted.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the non-compliant bucket. 3. Modify the bucket policy and ACL to
      remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable the "Block all public access"
      setting for the bucket. 5. Verify the bucket's access settings to ensure compliance.
