    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of unintended
      data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions settings.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the bucket settings.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
