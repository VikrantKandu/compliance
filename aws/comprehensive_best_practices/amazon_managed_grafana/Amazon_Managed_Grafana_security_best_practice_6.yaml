    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that no buckets have public read or write permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI to list bucket policies and check for 'Public' or 'Everyone' permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to update bucket policies to restrict access.
