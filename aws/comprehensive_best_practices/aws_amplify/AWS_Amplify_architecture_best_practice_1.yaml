    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure. If a bucket is publicly accessible, anyone on the internet can
      potentially access the data stored within, leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Check the "Permissions" tab to ensure that the bucket policy does not grant
      public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and adjust the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
