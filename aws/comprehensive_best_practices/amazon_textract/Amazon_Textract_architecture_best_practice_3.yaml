    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to inspect
      the ACL for public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove the public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to apply the necessary changes to
      the bucket settings.
