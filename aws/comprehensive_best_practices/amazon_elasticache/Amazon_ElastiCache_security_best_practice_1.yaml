    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy Requires Strong Passwords
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that the IAM password policy requires strong passwords
      to enhance security. A strong password policy includes requirements such as
      minimum length, complexity, and expiration to protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Implementing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Weak passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks, which can
      lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Account settings".
    - Review the password policy settings to ensure they meet the following criteria:
      - Minimum password length of at least 12 characters.
      - Passwords must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter,
        one number, and one special character.
      - Password expiration is set to 90 days or less.
      - Password reuse is prevented for at least the last 5 passwords.
    Default Value: By default, the IAM password policy is not configured with strong
      password requirements.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Account settings".
    - Configure the password policy to require a minimum length of 12 characters and
      include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and
      one special character.
    - Set password expiration to 90 days or less and prevent password reuse for at
      least the last 5 passwords.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
