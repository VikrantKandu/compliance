    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. Enabling MFA adds an
      extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: MFA significantly enhances the security of user accounts by reducing
      the risk of compromised credentials leading to unauthorized access. Without
      MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain full access
      to the AWS account and its resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - For each user, choose 'Security credentials' and click 'Manage' next to Assigned
      MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
    - Verify that MFA is successfully enabled for all users.
