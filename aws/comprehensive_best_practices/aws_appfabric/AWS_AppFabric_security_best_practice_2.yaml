    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure if sensitive
      data is stored within them. This check is crucial for maintaining data privacy
      and security.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      minimizes the risk of sensitive information being exposed to the internet.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked. 5. Verify that bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab and enable "Block all public access." 5. Review and update bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove any statements that allow public access.
