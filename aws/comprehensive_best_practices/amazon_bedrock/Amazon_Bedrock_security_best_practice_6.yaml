  - Title: Enable Versioning for S3 Buckets
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that versioning is enabled for all S3 buckets to protect against
      accidental or malicious data deletion or modification.
  - Rationale: Enabling versioning helps recover from unintended overwrites and deletions,
      providing a means to restore previous versions of objects. Without versioning,
      data loss can occur, which might lead to significant operational disruptions
      and data integrity issues.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the Properties tab.
    - Verify that the Versioning status is set to "Enabled".
  - Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default for S3 buckets.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket for which you want to enable versioning.
    - Go to the Properties tab and click on "Edit" under the Versioning section.
    - Select "Enable" and save the changes.
