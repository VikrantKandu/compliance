    Title: Ensure IAM User Password Policy Is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a password policy is enabled for IAM users
      to enforce strong password requirements and enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy helps protect against unauthorized
      access by requiring users to create complex passwords. Without a password policy,
      accounts are at risk of being compromised due to weak passwords.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings."
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured according to organizational
      requirements.
    Default Value: By default, no password policy is enforced for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings."
    - Enable the password policy and configure it to require at least one uppercase
      letter, one lowercase letter, one number, one non-alphanumeric character, and
      a minimum password length of 8 characters.
