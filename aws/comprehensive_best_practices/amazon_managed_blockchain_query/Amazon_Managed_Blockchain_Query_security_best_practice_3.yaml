    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and potential data loss.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Restricting access to authenticated users or specific IP addresses mitigates
      the risk of data breaches and ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings. Ensure that all options to block public
      access are enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      policy statements.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings on the S3 bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Review and modify any Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not grant
      public access.
