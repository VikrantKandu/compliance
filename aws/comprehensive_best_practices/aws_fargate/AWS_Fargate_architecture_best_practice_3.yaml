    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Encrypting data at rest
      is a fundamental security measure to protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that "Default encryption" is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have encryption enabled.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption."
    - Choose the desired encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
