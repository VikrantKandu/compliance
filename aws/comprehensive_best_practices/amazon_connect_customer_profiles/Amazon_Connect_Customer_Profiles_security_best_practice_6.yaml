    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or unauthorized
      data access, posing a significant security risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and check for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
