    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of authentication, thus protecting the account from
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the AWS root account is crucial as it provides additional
      security by requiring a second form of authentication. Without MFA, the root
      account is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to potential data
      breaches and misuse of resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as a root user. 2. Navigate to
      the IAM dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Dashboard'. 4. Check the
      'Security Status' section to verify if MFA is enabled on the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as a root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'IAM' dashboard. 3. In the 'Security Status' section, select 'Activate
      MFA on your root account'. 4. Choose a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
      5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA for the root account.
