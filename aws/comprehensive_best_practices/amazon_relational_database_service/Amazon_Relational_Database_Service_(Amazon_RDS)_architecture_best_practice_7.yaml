    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources if credentials are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA device and follow the instructions to assign an MFA device
      to the user.
