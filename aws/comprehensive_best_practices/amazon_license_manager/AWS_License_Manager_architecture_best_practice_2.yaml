    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible
      S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations. Public access
      can lead to data leaks and potential exploitation by malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
