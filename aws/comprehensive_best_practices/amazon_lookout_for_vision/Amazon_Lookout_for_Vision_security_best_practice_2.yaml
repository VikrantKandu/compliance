    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that a password policy is enabled for AWS IAM
      users. A strong password policy enforces complexity requirements, password expiration,
      and reuse prevention, which helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials by making it more difficult for attackers to guess or brute force
      passwords. Without a strong password policy, accounts are more vulnerable to
      unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that a password policy is configured with requirements for minimum length,
      special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters, as well as password expiration
      and reuse prevention.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce any password policy for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Click on 'Set password policy'.
    - Configure the password policy to include complexity requirements, password expiration,
      and reuse prevention.
    - Save the changes to enforce the policy.
