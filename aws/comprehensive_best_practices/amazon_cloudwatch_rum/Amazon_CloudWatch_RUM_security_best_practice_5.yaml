    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to grant specific access to users or roles as needed.
