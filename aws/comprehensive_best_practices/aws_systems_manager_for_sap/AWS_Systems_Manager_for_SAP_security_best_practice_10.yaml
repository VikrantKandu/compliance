    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      private by default helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure no bucket policy grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Review and modify the bucket ACLs and policies to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Config rules to continuously monitor and enforce the non-public accessibility
      of S3 buckets.
