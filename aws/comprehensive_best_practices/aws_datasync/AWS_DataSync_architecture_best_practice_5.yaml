    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches, as anyone on the internet can access the data stored in these
      buckets. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket's ACL to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
