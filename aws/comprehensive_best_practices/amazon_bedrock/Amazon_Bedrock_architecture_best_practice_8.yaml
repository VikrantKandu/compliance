    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that
      buckets are private helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and
      potential exploitation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public
      access permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL settings to remove
      public access.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' setting for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies to ensure they do not allow public access.
