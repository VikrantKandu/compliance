    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using IAM roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using IAM roles for
      secure access to AWS services. IAM roles provide temporary credentials, reducing
      the risk of long-term credentials being compromised.
    Rationale: Using IAM roles for EC2 instances enhances security by eliminating
      the need for storing AWS credentials on the instance. It also allows for more
      granular permissions management and auditing. Without IAM roles, there is a
      risk of credential leakage, leading to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the menu.
    - For each instance, check the "IAM Role" column to ensure an IAM role is attached.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and verify
      the IamInstanceProfile attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role assigned.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the necessary permissions for each instance.
    - Create an IAM role with the required permissions.
    - Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance via the AWS Management Console or AWS
      CLI.
    - Ensure that the application on the instance is configured to use the IAM role
      for accessing AWS services.
