    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
