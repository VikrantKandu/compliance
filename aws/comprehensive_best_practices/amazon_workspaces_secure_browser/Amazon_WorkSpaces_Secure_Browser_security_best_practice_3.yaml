  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict public access to
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket needing remediation.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable all block public access settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
