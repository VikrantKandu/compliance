    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data
      breaches and unauthorized access. Public exposure of sensitive data can lead
      to compliance violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket ACLs.
    - Verify that the bucket's Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
