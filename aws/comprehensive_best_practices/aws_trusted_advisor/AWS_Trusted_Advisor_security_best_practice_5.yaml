    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to provide an additional layer
      of security for accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. It helps protect against unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security Credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the "Security Credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage" under the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
