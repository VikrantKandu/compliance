    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account adds an extra layer of security. It
      is crucial because the root account has unrestricted access to all resources
      in the AWS account. Without MFA, the root account is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, which could lead to account compromise and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Check the security status section to see if MFA is enabled for the root account.
      4. Verify if the MFA device is active and configured correctly.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled on the root account by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
      2. Go to the IAM dashboard and select "Activate MFA on your root account." 3.
      Follow the instructions to set up a virtual or hardware MFA device. 4. Confirm
      the MFA setup by entering the generated authentication codes.
