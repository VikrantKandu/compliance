    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security for user sign-in procedures.
      It requires not only a password and username but also something that only the
      user has on them, i.e., a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, unauthorized users could gain access to AWS resources
      using stolen or weak passwords.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select each user and check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device.
