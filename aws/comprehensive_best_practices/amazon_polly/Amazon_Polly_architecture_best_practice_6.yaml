    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Limiting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to maintaining data
      privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access settings enabled, such as "Everyone"
      having read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not granted
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy and access control list
      (ACL).
    - Remove any public access settings by adjusting the bucket policy and ACL to
      restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
