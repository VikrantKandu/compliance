    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches. It is crucial to control access to S3 buckets to ensure that
      only authorized users and applications can access the data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations
      can protect sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
        aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that no public
        access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access to prevent future public access configurations.
