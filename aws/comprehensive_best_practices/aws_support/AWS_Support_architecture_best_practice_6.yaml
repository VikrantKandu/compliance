    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of
      security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms of identification
      before gaining access to AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring users to provide additional
      verification beyond just a password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      due to compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and check if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
