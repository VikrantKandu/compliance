    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in these buckets.
      Public access can lead to data leaks, regulatory non-compliance, and potential
      financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Check that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACL does not grant public read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies that grant public access.
    - Update bucket ACLs to ensure they do not allow public read or write permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future configurations that
      allow public access.
