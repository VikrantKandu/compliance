  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using the Latest AMI
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using the
      latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to incorporate the latest security patches
      and updates. Using outdated AMIs can expose the instance to vulnerabilities
      that have been addressed in more recent versions.
  - Rationale: Regularly updating AMIs is crucial for maintaining the security and
      stability of EC2 instances. Outdated AMIs may contain vulnerabilities that can
      be exploited by attackers, leading to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. List all running EC2 instances and note their AMI IDs. 4. Compare the AMI
      IDs with the latest AMI versions available in the AWS Marketplace or your custom
      AMI catalog. 5. Identify any instances not using the latest AMI versions.
  - Default Value: EC2 instances are not automatically updated to the latest AMI.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances not using the latest AMI. 2. Create a new instance
      using the latest AMI. 3. Migrate data and applications from the old instance
      to the new one. 4. Terminate the outdated instance.
