    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized data
      access, data breaches, and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to critical data exposure and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify bucket permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy or ACLs.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Review and adjust IAM policies to ensure they do not grant public access to
      S3 buckets.
