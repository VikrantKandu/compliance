  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps safeguard
      sensitive data by encrypting it using AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3), AWS Key Management
      Service (SSE-KMS), or customer-provided keys (SSE-C).
  - Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the 'Properties' tab for 'Default Encryption'.
      5. Verify that server-side encryption is enabled using SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that requires encryption. 4. Go to the 'Properties' tab
      and select 'Default Encryption'. 5. Choose an encryption method (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS,
      or SSE-C) and save the changes.
