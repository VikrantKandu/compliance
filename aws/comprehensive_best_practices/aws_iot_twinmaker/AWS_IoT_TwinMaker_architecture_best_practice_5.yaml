    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      data to the internet, leading to potential data loss or misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List" (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the ACL is not set to allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify bucket policies.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, update the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control
      List" (ACL) to remove public access.
    - Utilize the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
