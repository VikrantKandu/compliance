  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is stored. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure all options are enabled. 5. Verify the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console and select the bucket. 2. Click on the "Permissions"
      tab. 3. Under "Block public access," click "Edit" and enable all settings. 4.
      Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
      5. Save the changes to apply the new settings.
