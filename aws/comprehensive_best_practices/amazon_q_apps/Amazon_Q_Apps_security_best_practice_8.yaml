    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data leakage, compliance violations, and potential financial
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket_name>'
      to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent public access
      configurations.
