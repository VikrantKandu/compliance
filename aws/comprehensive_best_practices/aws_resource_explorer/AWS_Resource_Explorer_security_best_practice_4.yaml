    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Access is Restricted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and that access is restricted to only authorized users and applications.
      This is important to prevent unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data
      stored in S3.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized data
      manipulation, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the bucket is not configured for public access in the Block Public
      Access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure continued compliance.
