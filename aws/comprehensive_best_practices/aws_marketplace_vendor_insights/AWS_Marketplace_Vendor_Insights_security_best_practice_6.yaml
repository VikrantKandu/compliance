    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure, making it crucial to restrict
      access to only intended users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      access helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
