  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. By ensuring buckets are private, you protect
      sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized users.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Ensure there are no bucket policies or
      ACLs that grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block
      all public access" if it is not already enabled. 5. Review bucket policies and
      ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access. Remove any statements that grant
      public access.
