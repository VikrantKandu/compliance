    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can allow unauthorized users to access,
      modify, or delete data. This can result in data leaks, loss of data integrity,
      and compliance violations. Restricting access to buckets ensures that only authorized
      users can access the data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
