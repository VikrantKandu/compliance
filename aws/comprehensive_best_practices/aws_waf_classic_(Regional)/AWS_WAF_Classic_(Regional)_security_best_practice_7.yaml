  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the public internet. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets. 2.
      Check the bucket permissions to ensure that the "Block all public access" setting
      is enabled. 3. Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Enable the "Block all public access"
      setting for the bucket. 4. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove
      any public access permissions.
