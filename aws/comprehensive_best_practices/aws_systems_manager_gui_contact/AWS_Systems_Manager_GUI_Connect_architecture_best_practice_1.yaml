    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not public protects sensitive information
      and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, enable 'Block all public access'
      in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any statements that allow
      public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      only authorized users.
