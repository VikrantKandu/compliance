    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible by default helps protect
      data from accidental exposure and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review the "Block public access" settings and ensure all options are enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify that they do
      not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket in the AWS Management Console
      under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any statements that allow
      public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to
      authorized users only.
