    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless
      explicitly required. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Confirm that the buckets do not have public access unless explicitly required
      for a specific use case.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket that is publicly accessible, review and update the bucket policy
      and permissions to restrict public access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to further
      control access.
