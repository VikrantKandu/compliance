    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with various regulatory
      requirements.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of unauthorized access to
      sensitive information. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets could be
      exposed in the event of a security breach or misconfiguration.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Check if "Default encryption" is enabled. Ensure that either "SSE-S3" or "SSE-KMS"
      is selected.
    - Repeat the process for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption."
    - Select either "SSE-S3" or "SSE-KMS" based on your encryption requirements.
    - Apply the changes and repeat for all unencrypted buckets.
