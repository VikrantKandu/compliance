    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to
      their password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring additional
      verification, which is particularly important for sensitive operations. Without
      MFA, compromised credentials could lead to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, click on 'Manage' under the 'MFA device' section
      in the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
