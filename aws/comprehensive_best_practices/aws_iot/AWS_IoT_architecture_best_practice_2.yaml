    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can result in sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
