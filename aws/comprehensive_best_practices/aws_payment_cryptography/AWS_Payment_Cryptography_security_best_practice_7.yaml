    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible Only When Necessary
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required for business purposes. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure, data breaches, and compliance violations. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have a public access setting unless it is necessary
      for business needs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that should not be publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust any policies that might grant public access inadvertently.
