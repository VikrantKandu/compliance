    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to
      provide a second form of authentication, which helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      by requiring a second factor of authentication. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker
      who obtains a user's password could gain full access to the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      verify the status of MFA for IAM users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
