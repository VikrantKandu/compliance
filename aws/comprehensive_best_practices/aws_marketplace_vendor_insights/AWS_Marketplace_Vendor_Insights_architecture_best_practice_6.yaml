    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted at Rest
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets
      may be vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Default encryption" settings in the "Properties"
      tab.
    - Verify that either AWS-KMS or AES-256 encryption is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption".
    - Choose the desired encryption method (AWS-KMS or AES-256) and save the changes.
