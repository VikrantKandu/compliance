    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private by default,
      restricting public access unless explicitly required. This prevents unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. It is crucial to
      restrict access to only those who need it.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all
      public access' is enabled. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: Buckets are private by default, but configuration settings can
      be changed to allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that needs to be
      made private. 3. Click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable 'Block all public
      access' and save the changes. 5. Review bucket policies and access control lists
      (ACLs) to ensure no public access is granted.
