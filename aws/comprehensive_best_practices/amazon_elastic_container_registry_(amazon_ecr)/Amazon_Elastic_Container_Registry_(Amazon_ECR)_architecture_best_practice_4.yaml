    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to buckets can
      lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      posing a significant security risk. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      data from unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Check the 'Block
      public access' settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible. 5.
      Verify there are no public access policies attached to the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured to be public.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket you want to modify. 3. Click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable
      'Block all public access' to prevent the bucket from being publicly accessible.
      5. Remove any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow public
      access.
