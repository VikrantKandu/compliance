    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudFormation stacks use encryption for sensitive
      data to protect information from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
    Rationale: Encrypting sensitive data within CloudFormation stacks helps protect
      against data breaches and unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive
      information could be exposed, potentially leading to data loss or compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Review the stack templates to ensure that sensitive data, such as S3 buckets
      or RDS instances, are configured with encryption options.
    - Verify that encryption is enabled for all applicable resources in the stack.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation does not enforce encryption on resources
      unless specified in the template.
    Remediation:
    - Update the CloudFormation template to include encryption options for sensitive
      resources.
    - Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Enable encryption for RDS instances and other supported services.
    - Deploy the updated stack to apply changes.
