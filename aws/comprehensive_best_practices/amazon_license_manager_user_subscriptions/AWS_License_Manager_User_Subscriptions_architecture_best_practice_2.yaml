    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private
      Cloud (VPC). This is a fundamental security best practice that provides network
      isolation and control over inbound and outbound traffic.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC allows for better control over
      network access and security. Without a VPC, instances may be exposed to the
      public internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the navigation pane.
    - Verify that all instances have a VPC ID associated with them.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check
      the 'VpcId' attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched within the default VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any EC2 instances not within a VPC.
    - Migrate these instances to a VPC by creating an AMI of the instance, launching
      a new instance within a VPC using this AMI, and then terminating the old instance.
