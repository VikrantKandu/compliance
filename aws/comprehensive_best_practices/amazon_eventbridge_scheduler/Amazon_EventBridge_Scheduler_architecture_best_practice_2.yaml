    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required
      for application functionality.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets may be configured to allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private helps
      protect sensitive data and prevents accidental leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or access control lists that grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may vary
      based on user actions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket to be modified.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access.'
    - Review and modify bucket policies and access control lists to remove any public
      access permissions.
