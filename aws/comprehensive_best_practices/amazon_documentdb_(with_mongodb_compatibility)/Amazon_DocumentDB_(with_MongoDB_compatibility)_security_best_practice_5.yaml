    Title: Ensure that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. It is crucial
      to restrict public access to maintain data security and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions and ensure that the bucket does not
      have any public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure it does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, remove the public access permissions by
      updating the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
