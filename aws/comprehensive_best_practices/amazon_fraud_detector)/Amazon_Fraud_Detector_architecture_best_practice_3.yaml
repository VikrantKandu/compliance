    Title: Enable Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for all EC2 instances
      to provide more granular metrics. Detailed monitoring provides data in 1-minute
      periods, allowing for more precise tracking of instance performance and health.
    Rationale: Enabling detailed monitoring allows for better visibility into the
      performance of EC2 instances, facilitating quicker response to issues and more
      informed decision-making. Without detailed monitoring, data is only available
      in 5-minute intervals, which may delay detection of performance issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check if Detailed Monitoring is enabled under the Monitoring
      tab.
    Default Value: By default, detailed monitoring is not enabled for EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select the instance for which you want to enable detailed monitoring.
    - Click on the Actions button, then select Monitor and troubleshoot, and choose
      Enable detailed monitoring.
    - Confirm the changes to start collecting detailed metrics.
