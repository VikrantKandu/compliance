    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive information to the internet, leading to data loss and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Save the changes.
