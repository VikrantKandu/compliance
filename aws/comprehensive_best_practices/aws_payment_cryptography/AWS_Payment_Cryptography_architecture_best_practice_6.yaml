  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, which can be exploited by malicious
      actors.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data leakage and unauthorized data access. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab. 4. Verify that there are no public
      access permissions granted. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket ACLs. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review bucket policies. 7.
      Ensure that both ACLs and bucket policies do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL. 2.
      Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
      3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
