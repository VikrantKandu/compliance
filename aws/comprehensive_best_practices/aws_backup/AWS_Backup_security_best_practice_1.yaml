    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users who have a console password. MFA provides an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, which helps protect
      against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of user accounts by requiring additional
      verification beyond just a username and password. This reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials leading to unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA devices and verify compliance.
    Default Value: IAM users are created without MFA enabled by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device.
