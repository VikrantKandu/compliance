    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized data access. Misconfigured S3 buckets can lead to significant
      security incidents and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
