    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires a second form
      of authentication, improving the security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker with the root password
      could gain full access to the AWS account, potentially leading to data breaches
      or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the Users section.
    - Check the Security Credentials tab for the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with the root account.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Activate MFA on the root account.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device, U2F security key,
      or other supported methods.
