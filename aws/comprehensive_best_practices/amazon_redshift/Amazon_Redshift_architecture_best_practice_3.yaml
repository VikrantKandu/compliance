    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets could lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you protect sensitive data
      from being exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL to ensure that they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify the bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to restrict public access at the account
      level.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL comply with the principle of least privilege.
