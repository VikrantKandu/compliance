    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security beyond just a username
      and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access, as it requires an additional authentication factor. Without
      MFA, the root account is vulnerable to compromise if the password is exposed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Dashboard" option.
    - Check the "Security Status" section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the "Security Status" section, click on "Activate MFA on your root account."
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual or hardware MFA device.
