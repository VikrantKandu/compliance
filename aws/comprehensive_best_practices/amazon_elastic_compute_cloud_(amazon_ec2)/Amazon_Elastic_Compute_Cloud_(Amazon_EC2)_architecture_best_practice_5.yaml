    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Bucket Policy
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have a bucket policy applied.
      Bucket policies allow you to define permissions at the bucket level and help
      in managing access control efficiently.
    Rationale: Applying a bucket policy is crucial for controlling access to your
      S3 buckets. Without a bucket policy, unauthorized users may gain access to sensitive
      data, leading to data breaches or data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that a bucket policy is applied and review its content to ensure it meets
      your security requirements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have a bucket policy applied.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have a policy.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and click on Bucket Policy.
    - Create a policy that specifies the required access controls and save it.
