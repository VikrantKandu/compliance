  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are private by default is a critical security measure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Limiting access to only authorized users reduces
      the risk of data exposure.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Ensure that the bucket ACL (Access Control
      List) settings do not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket
      policy to restrict public access. 2. Update the bucket ACL settings to remove
      any public access permissions. 3. Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to
      prevent public access at the account level.
