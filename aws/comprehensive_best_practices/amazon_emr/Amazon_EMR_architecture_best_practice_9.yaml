    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security to protect
      AWS accounts from unauthorized access. MFA requires users to provide a second
      form of authentication, typically a code from a mobile device, in addition to
      their password.
    Rationale: Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's password could
      potentially access and compromise the AWS account. MFA significantly reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access by requiring an additional verification step.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Check the 'MFA' column to verify
      that MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to use MFA.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 4. Choose the 'Security
      credentials' tab. 5. Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 6. Follow
      the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
