    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data
      exposure.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you minimize the risk of
      sensitive data being exposed to unauthorized users. Public access can lead to
      data leaks, compliance violations, and potential financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket policies and check for
      public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the S3 bucket policy.
    - Update the bucket ACLs to remove public access.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
