    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data
      exposure.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Misconfigured buckets can lead to
      sensitive data being accessible to anyone on the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for all accounts
      and buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket and account level.
    - Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
