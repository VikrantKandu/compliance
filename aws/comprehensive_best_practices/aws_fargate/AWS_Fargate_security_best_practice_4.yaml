    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an additional layer of
      security. MFA requires users to provide two or more authentication factors,
      reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring additional verification
      steps beyond just a password. Without MFA, an attacker with a user's password
      could gain access to AWS resources, potentially leading to unauthorized actions
      and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the sidebar.
    - Check each user to ensure MFA is enabled by reviewing the "MFA device" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices for each user to verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select Users.
    - For each user without MFA, click on the user name, then click on the "Security
      credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", choose "Manage MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
