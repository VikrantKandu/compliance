    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in them. By default,
      S3 buckets can be publicly accessible, which can lead to data exposure if not
      properly managed.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is essential to protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches,
      data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Check if any bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically list bucket permissions and verify their
      access policies.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private, but configurations
      can be changed to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block public access settings and ensure all options are checked to
      block public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Save changes to apply the new configurations.
