    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide an additional authentication
      factor beyond their password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's password
      could gain full access to their permissions. MFA ensures that even if a password
      is compromised, the account remains secure.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      Credentials' tab for MFA device status. 5. Verify that an MFA device is assigned
      to each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Select a user without
      MFA enabled. 5. Go to the 'Security Credentials' tab. 6. Click on 'Manage MFA'
      and follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
