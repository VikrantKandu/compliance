    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by attackers
      to access or manipulate data without proper authorization.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Check for any public access policies or permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for public policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access settings.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent unintended public
      access.
