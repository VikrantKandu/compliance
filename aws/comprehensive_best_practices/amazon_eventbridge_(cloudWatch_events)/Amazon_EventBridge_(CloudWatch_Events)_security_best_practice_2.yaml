    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly
      required for the application. This configuration helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are private
      by default reduces the risk of accidental data exposure and helps maintain data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets in the account.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access and that the ACL
      is set to private.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - If any S3 bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy
      to remove public access permissions.
    - Set the bucket ACL to private by modifying the settings in the AWS Management
      Console or using the AWS CLI.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket to prevent future accidental
      public exposure.
