  - Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation stacks are monitored for drift
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Regularly monitor AWS CloudFormation stacks for drift to ensure that
      the actual configuration of resources matches the expected configuration defined
      in the stack template. Drift detection helps identify changes that were made
      outside of CloudFormation and ensures that infrastructure remains consistent
      with desired configurations.
  - Rationale: Monitoring for drift is crucial to maintain infrastructure integrity
      and security. Unmonitored changes could lead to unexpected behavior, security
      vulnerabilities, or compliance issues. Regular drift detection helps in identifying
      and rectifying unauthorized changes promptly.
  - Audit: 1. Access the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select a stack to review. 4. Choose 'Actions' and then 'Detect drift'.
      5. Review the drift status to confirm if any resources have drifted. 6. Ensure
      that drift detection is performed regularly and documented.
  - Default Value: CloudFormation stacks do not have drift detection enabled by default.
  - Remediation: 1. Access the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select the stack with detected drift. 4. Review the drift details
      and identify unauthorized changes. 5. Use CloudFormation to update the stack
      or manually revert changes to match the stack template. 6. Implement regular
      drift detection schedules and monitor results to ensure compliance.
