    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, meaning they are not publicly accessible. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data loss, privacy violations, and compliance issues. Ensuring
      S3 buckets are private mitigates these risks by restricting access to only authorized
      users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Confirm that the bucket is not publicly accessible by checking the "Block all
      public access" settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure
      no public access is granted.
