    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should have appropriate
      access controls to ensure data privacy and security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data leaks. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default
      mitigates these risks and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the access control list for each bucket.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly made public.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block Public Access settings and ensure all options to block public
      access are checked.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and access control list to restrict public
      access.
