    Title: Ensure CloudFormation Stacks Have Termination Protection Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudFormation stacks should have termination protection enabled
      to prevent accidental deletion. This feature adds an additional layer of protection
      for critical resources managed by CloudFormation.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection helps safeguard against unintended
      deletions of CloudFormation stacks, which could lead to loss of critical infrastructure
      and data. Accidental deletions can result in downtime, data loss, and increased
      recovery time.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select a stack to review.
    - Check the stack details to verify if termination protection is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name
        <stack-name> and check for the "EnableTerminationProtection" attribute.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is not enabled for CloudFormation
      stacks.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select the stack for which you want to enable termination protection.
    - Choose the "Stack actions" dropdown menu.
    - Select "Enable termination protection."
    - Confirm the action to enable protection.
