  - Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks Are Monitored
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: It is essential to monitor AWS CloudFormation stacks to ensure that
      changes and updates are tracked and that the infrastructure remains compliant
      with organizational policies.
  - Rationale: Monitoring CloudFormation stacks helps detect unauthorized changes,
      maintain compliance, and ensure that infrastructure is deployed as intended.
      If not monitored, there is a risk of undetected changes leading to security
      vulnerabilities and non-compliance with regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Check for the presence of stack events and any integrations with
      AWS CloudTrail or AWS Config. 4. Verify that notifications are set up for stack
      changes using SNS topics or other alerting mechanisms.
  - Default Value: By default, CloudFormation does not automatically enable monitoring
      or notifications for stack changes.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable AWS CloudTrail to log CloudFormation API calls. 2. Set
      up AWS Config to monitor CloudFormation stack resources. 3. Configure SNS notifications
      for stack updates and changes. 4. Regularly review stack events and logs to
      ensure compliance with organizational policies.
