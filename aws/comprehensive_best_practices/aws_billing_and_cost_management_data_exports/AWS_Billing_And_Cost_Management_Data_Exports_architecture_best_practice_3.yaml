    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring a second form of authentication, which helps protect
      user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      prevent unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, user accounts are
      more vulnerable to compromise, especially if passwords are weak or have been
      exposed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user that needs MFA enabled.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
