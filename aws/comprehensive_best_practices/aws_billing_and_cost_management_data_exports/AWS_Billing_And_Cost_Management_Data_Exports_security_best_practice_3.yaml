    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, preventing
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access statements.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets.
