    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to data stored in the cloud. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with security policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
