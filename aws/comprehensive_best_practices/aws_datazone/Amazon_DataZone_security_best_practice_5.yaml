    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive data and unauthorized
      data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks and ensures data is only accessible to authorized users.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure that all options are enabled. 5. Review the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket. 2. Review
      and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions. 3. Adjust
      the ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
