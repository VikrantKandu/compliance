    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      meaning that they do not allow public access. This is important to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab to verify that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the bucket's ACL settings.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, but users may modify settings
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the 'Permissions' tab in the
      AWS Management Console for the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to ensure the bucket is private.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
