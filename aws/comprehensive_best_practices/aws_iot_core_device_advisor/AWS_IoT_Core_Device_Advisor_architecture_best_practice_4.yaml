    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      might not be secure for all instances.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintentional exposure
      of services and data. Custom security groups should be used to enforce the principle
      of least privilege and restrict access to only what is necessary.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are associated with the default security group if
      no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance requirements.
    - Associate the instances with the new security group and disassociate them from
      the default security group.
