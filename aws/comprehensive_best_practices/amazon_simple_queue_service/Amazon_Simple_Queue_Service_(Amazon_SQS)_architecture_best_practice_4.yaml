    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data
      access, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - Click on any bucket marked as "Public" and review its permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
