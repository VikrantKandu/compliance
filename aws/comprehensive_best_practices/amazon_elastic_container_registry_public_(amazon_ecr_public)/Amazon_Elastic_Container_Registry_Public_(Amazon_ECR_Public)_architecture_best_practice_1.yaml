    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk by
      allowing anyone on the internet to access the data stored within them. This
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-name to check
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
