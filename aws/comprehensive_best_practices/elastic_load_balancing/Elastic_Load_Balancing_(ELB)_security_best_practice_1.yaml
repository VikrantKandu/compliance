    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public access can lead
      to accidental data exposure and compromise of sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any bucket marked
      as Public.
    - Click on the bucket name to view the Permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public read/write access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Enable the Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
