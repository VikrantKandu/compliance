    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps secure sensitive
      data and meet compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling encryption helps
      protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
      to programmatically check the encryption status of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to enable encryption for.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
