    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all data stored in Amazon S3 buckets is encrypted to
      protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and to comply with data
      protection regulations.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest helps protect it from unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches. Without encryption, sensitive data could be exposed
      if accessed by unauthorized parties, leading to compliance violations and reputational
      damage.
    Audit: Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to list all S3 buckets
      and check their encryption settings. Verify that server-side encryption is enabled
      for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: Enable server-side encryption for each S3 bucket. This can be done
      through the AWS Management Console by navigating to the bucket properties and
      selecting the desired encryption option, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI or SDKs to enable encryption programmatically.
