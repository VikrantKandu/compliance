    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials by requiring
      a second factor of authentication. This is particularly important for users
      with elevated privileges. Without MFA, unauthorized access can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that MFA is activated for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' next to 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
