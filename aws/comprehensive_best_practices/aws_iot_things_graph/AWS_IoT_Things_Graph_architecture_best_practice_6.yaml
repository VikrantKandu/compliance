    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to be private to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. By default, AWS S3 buckets are private, but any public
      access configuration should be explicitly reviewed and justified.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private minimizes the risk of data breaches and
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive
      information, resulting in compliance violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access unless explicitly required and documented.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, review the necessity of the access.
    - If public access is not required, modify the bucket permissions to remove public
      access.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Use AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access to the bucket securely.
