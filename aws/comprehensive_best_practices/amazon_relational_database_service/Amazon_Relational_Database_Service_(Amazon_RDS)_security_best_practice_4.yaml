    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Launched in a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual
      Private Cloud (VPC). VPCs provide enhanced security and networking capabilities,
      allowing for better control over network traffic and security configurations.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC is recommended to leverage advanced
      networking features such as security groups, network ACLs, and private IP addressing.
      Without a VPC, instances may be exposed to security vulnerabilities and limited
      network control.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Verify that all instances have a VPC ID associated with them.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC unless
      specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any EC2 instances not launched in a VPC.
    - Stop the instance.
    - Create a new VPC if necessary.
    - Launch the instance within the desired VPC.
    - Terminate the original instance if no longer needed.
