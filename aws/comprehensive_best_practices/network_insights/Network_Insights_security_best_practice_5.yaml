    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps protect the data
      stored in S3 from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps safeguard sensitive
      data and comply with data protection regulations. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the bucket properties and enable server-side encryption with the desired
      encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
