    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that a strong password policy is configured in AWS IAM to
      enhance security by enforcing password complexity and rotation.
    Rationale: A strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      by requiring users to create complex passwords and change them regularly. Without
      a password policy, accounts are more vulnerable to brute-force attacks and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Account settings."
    - Verify that a password policy is enabled and configured with the following settings:
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Require passwords to be rotated every 90 days or less.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Account settings."
    - Click "Edit" in the "Password Policy" section.
    - Configure the password policy with the recommended settings:
      - Enable all complexity requirements.
      - Set a minimum password length of 8 characters.
      - Enable password expiration and set it to 90 days.
    - Save the changes to enforce the password policy.
