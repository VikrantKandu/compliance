    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires not only a
      password but also a second factor, such as a code from a smartphone app, to
      access the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If the root account credentials are compromised, an attacker
      would still need the MFA device to gain access. Without MFA, the root account
      is vulnerable to attacks that could lead to data breaches and unauthorized changes
      to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to see if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and verify
      that the AccountMFAEnabled key is set to true.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click on 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA
      device.
