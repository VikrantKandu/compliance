    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data leakage and compromise the security of the stored information.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
      service. 3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control
      list (ACL). 4. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5.
      Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 bucket. 2.
      Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket. 3. Review and update the
      bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access. 4. Regularly audit bucket permissions
      to ensure compliance.
