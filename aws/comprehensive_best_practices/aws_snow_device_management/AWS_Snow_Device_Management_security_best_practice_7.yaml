    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of identification. This best practice ensures that all IAM users
      in the AWS account have MFA enabled, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of credential
      compromise. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker
      could gain full access to AWS resources. By enforcing MFA, even if the password
      is compromised, the attacker would still need the second factor to gain access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select "Users."
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled. This can be done by selecting a
      user and reviewing the "Security credentials" tab for MFA status.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
        check if all users have an associated MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab and click on "Manage" under the "Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)" section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
    - Ensure that the user is informed about the MFA setup process and completes the
      activation.
