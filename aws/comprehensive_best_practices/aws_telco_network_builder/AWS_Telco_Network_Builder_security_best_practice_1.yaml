    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires users
      to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing account protection against
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from being compromised due
      to lost or stolen credentials. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to
      unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches or other security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device' and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA.
