    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk
      of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has "Public" access unless explicitly required and justified.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove the public access by
      updating the bucket's ACL and policy settings.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to modify the bucket permissions.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access
      configurations.
