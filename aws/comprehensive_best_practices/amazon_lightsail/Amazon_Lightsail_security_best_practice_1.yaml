    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions that could expose sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can
      lead to data breaches if sensitive information is stored in them.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be a significant security risk,
      potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public read or write access.
    - Check the Access Control List (ACL) settings to confirm that they do not allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      verify the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access must be explicitly
      granted.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy.
    - Adjust the ACL settings to ensure that no public access is allowed.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or individual buckets
      to prevent public access configurations.
