    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive
      information and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
