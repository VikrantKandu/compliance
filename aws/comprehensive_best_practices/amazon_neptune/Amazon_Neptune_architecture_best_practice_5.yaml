    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting access helps to protect sensitive information and
      comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public Access" enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and disable "Public Access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
