    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached to Groups or Roles Instead of Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are attached to groups or roles
      rather than directly to individual users. This practice simplifies management
      and enhances security by allowing centralized access control.
    Rationale: Attaching policies to groups or roles rather than users reduces the
      complexity of permissions management and minimizes the risk of privilege escalation.
      It also ensures that access rights are consistent among users with similar roles
      and responsibilities.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs to list all IAM policies.
    - Identify policies that are directly attached to users.
    - Verify that these policies can be attached to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach the policy from the user.
    - Create or identify an appropriate IAM group or role.
    - Attach the policy to the group or role.
    - Add the user to the group or assign the role to the user if necessary.
