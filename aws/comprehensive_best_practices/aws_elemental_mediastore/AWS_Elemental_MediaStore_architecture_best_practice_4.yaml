    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in sensitive data exposure,
      data breaches, and non-compliance with data protection regulations. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL and ensure it does not include public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
