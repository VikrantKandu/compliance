    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive data and complies
      with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket allows public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to update bucket permissions.
    - Remove any public access permissions or policies from the bucket.
    - Implement bucket policies that restrict access to specific users or roles as
      necessary.
