    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      loss of confidentiality, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Access Control List" and "Bucket Policy" settings.
    - Verify that no settings allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Adjust the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review and update the "Access Control List" and "Bucket Policy" to remove any
      public access permissions.
