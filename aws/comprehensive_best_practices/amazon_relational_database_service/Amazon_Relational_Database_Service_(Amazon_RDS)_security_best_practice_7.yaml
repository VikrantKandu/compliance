    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access to enhance security by requiring an additional
      verification step during login.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username
      and password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing or brute
      force.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the specific user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under the 'Assigned MFA device' section and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA.
    - Ensure that all IAM users with console access have MFA enabled.
