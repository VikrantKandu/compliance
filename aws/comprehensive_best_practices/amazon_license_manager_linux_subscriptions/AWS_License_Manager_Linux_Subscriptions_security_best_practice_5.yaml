    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of passwords, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access
      AWS resources.
    Rationale: MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access by requiring
      a second form of verification in addition to a password. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to password-based attacks, which could lead to unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, AWS IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user who needs MFA enabled.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
