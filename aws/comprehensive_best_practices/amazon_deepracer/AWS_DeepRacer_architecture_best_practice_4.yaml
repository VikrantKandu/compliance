    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, typically
      a one-time code from a hardware or software token, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised passwords could allow attackers
      to gain access to sensitive resources and data. MFA helps protect against unauthorized
      access even if a password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA device" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA
      devices associated with each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Select a user and choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
