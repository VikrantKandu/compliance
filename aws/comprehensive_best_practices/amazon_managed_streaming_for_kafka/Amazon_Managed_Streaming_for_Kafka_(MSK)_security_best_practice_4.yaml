    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access permissions.
    - Ensure that no bucket is configured with public access unless explicitly required
      and justified.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove
      public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings to prevent future public access configurations.
