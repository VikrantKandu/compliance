    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to provide an additional layer of security for accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a
      second form of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if a user's
      password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
