    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to
      sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Restricting access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data privacy and
      security.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket's permissions tab to ensure
      that public access is blocked. 5. Verify that the bucket policy does not allow
      public access. 6. Confirm that the Access Control List (ACL) settings do not
      grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the
      S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select the bucket and go to the
      permissions tab. 3. Block all public access settings. 4. Review and modify the
      bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access. 5. Adjust the ACL settings
      to remove any public access permissions.
