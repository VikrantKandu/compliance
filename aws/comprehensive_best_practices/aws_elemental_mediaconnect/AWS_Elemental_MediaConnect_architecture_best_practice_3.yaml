    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can expose confidential information and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private by default
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that 'Block
      all public access' is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> and verify that no 'Everyone' or 'Authenticated Users'
      group has access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab and click on 'Block public access'. 5. Enable 'Block all public access'
      and save changes. 6. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant
      public access.
