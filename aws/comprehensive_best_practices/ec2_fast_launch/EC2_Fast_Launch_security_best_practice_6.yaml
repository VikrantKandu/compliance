    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and expose confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      potentially leading to data leaks, breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that buckets are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for any buckets marked as
      Public.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access settings to ensure compliance.
