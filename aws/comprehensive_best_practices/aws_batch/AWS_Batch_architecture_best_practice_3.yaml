  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      bucket access to only authorized users minimizes these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Everyone" or "Any Authenticated AWS User"
      with read or write permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check bucket permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement bucket policies or IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users
      only.
