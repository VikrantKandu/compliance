    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      both a password and a one-time code from a device they own. This reduces the
      risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
      to check for MFA device associations.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select "Users".
    - For each user, click on "Manage MFA".
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user, using either a virtual MFA device
      or a hardware MFA device.
