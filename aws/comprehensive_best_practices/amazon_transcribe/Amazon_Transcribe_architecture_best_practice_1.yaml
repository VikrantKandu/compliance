    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data and pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is stored within them. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets in your account.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      that they do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for each bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with access restrictions.
