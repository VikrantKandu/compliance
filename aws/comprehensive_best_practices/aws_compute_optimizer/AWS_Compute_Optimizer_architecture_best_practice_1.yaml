    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized users. Public access can result in data leaks, compliance
      violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) granting
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
