    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      enhancing the security of user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of protection on top
      of standard username and password. Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches and other security
      incidents.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled by selecting the user and reviewing the "Security credentials" tab.
      5. Ensure that the "Assigned MFA device" section shows a configured device for
      each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In
      the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage" and follow the prompts to
      assign an MFA device. 7. Repeat for each user without MFA enabled.
