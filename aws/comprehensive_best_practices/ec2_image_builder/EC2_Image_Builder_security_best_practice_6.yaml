    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users in
      your AWS account have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled to provide an
      extra layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly enhances account security
      by requiring a second form of authentication. If MFA is not enabled, unauthorized
      actors who gain access to user credentials can potentially compromise the account.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA Enabled' column to verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to the Assigned MFA device option.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and enable an MFA device for the user.
