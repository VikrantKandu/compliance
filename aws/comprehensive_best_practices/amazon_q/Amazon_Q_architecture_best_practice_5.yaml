    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      sensitive AWS resources and data.
    Rationale: Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Enabling MFA reduces the risk of credential theft and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and go to the Security credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
