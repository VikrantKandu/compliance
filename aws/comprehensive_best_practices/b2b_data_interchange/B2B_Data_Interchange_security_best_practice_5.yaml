    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions. 4. Check the 'Block
      Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify that the bucket
      policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket. 2. Review
      and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
