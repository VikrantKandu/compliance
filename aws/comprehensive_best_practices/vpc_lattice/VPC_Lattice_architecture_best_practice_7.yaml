  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data
      breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      which can lead to unauthorized access and data leakage. Ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance
      with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure public access is restricted. 5. Verify the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Navigate to the Permissions tab and
      enable "Block all public access." 4. Review and update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove any public access permissions. 5. Save the changes to apply the
      new settings.
