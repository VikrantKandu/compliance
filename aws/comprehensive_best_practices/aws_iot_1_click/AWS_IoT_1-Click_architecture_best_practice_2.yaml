    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      by verifying the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs). Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket policy and ACLs. 4. Verify that there
      are no public access permissions granted. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy to review permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket
      policy and ACLs. 4. Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
      5. Verify that no public access is allowed.
