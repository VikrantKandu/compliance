    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects data from being exposed
      to the internet. Unauthorized access can result in data breaches, data loss,
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - Click on each bucket, go to the 'Permissions' tab, and verify that 'Block all
      public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save the changes.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
