    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an additional layer of security to user accounts and prevent
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password
      and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece
      of information only they should know or have immediately to hand. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section.
    - Check each user account to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the "Users" section and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab and select "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the steps to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
