    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure.
      Ensuring that buckets are private helps protect data from unauthorized access
      and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab and ensure that the bucket policies
      and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
