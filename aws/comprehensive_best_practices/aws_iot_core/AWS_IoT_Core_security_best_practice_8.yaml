    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic. Using the default
      security group can expose your instances to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Applying
      restrictive security group rules minimizes exposure to potential threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Review the 'Security Groups' column for each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if not specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your application's needs.
    - Associate the new security group with the affected instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
