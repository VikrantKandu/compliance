    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private, preventing
      unauthorized public access. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict access
      to only authorized users and services.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Verify that no bucket has a public access policy or ACL that allows public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
