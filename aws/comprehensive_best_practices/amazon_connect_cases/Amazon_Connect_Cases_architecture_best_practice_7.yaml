    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, so
      it is crucial to restrict access and ensure that only authorized users can access
      the data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and potential data loss. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private
      by default minimizes the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column to ensure that no bucket
      is marked as "Public".
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not granted
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that needs to be secured.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket to prevent future
      public access configurations.
