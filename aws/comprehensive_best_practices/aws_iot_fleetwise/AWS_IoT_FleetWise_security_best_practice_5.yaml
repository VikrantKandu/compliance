    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Review the bucket policy and access control
      lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to
      remove any public access permissions.
