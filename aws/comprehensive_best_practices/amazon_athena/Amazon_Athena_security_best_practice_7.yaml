    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      users but are instead attached to groups or roles. This practice promotes better
      management and control over permissions.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      management and increased risk of privilege escalation. By attaching policies
      to groups or roles, permissions can be managed more efficiently and securely.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and review each user's attached policies.
    - Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles rather than directly to
      users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached directly to users.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies directly attached to users.
    - Create or identify appropriate groups or roles for the required permissions.
    - Attach the policies to the identified groups or roles.
    - Add users to the groups or roles as necessary.
