    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the
      internet, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are private minimizes this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and block public access settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not block public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
