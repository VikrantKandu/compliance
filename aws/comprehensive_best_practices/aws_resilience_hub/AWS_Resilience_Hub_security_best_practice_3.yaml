    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access. This is important
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of exposing sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI with the command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI with the command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket ACL to remove
      public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
