    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible pose a significant security
      risk as they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can result in data
      breaches, data loss, and unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to review the permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access to all buckets
      in the account.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
