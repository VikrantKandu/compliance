    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that S3 bucket policies and ACLs
      do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access, exposing sensitive information to the internet. Restricting public
      access minimizes the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket's ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Enable "Block public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust the ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to further
      restrict access.
