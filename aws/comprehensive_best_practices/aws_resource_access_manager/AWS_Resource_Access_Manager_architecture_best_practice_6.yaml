    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional authentication
      factors beyond just a password. This helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to credential theft or weak passwords. Without MFA, an attacker
      who gains access to a user's password can easily access AWS resources, potentially
      leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically check the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
