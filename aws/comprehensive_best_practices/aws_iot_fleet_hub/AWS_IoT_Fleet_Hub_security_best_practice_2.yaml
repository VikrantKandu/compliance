    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: By restricting public access, you reduce the risk of exposing sensitive
      data to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
