    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect data
      from unauthorized access and is a critical component of a comprehensive data
      security strategy.
    Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets is recommended to prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, which can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Default encryption" settings under "Properties".
    - Ensure that server-side encryption (SSE) is enabled with either Amazon S3-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption", select "Enable" and choose either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
