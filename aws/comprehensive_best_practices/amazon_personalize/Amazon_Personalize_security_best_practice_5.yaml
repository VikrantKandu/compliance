    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of username and password, requiring a second form of verification, typically
      a code from a mobile device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access to
      the root account credentials can perform any action in the AWS account, potentially
      leading to data breaches, data loss, and unauthorized use of resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account by viewing the security status
      on the dashboard.
    - Verify that the MFA device is configured and active.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
    - Ensure the MFA device is successfully configured and tested.
