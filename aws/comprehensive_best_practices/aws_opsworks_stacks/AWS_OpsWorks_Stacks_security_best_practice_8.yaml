    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. This best practice helps
      in limiting exposure to potential security threats.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to and from the instance. Restricting access through custom
      security groups helps in minimizing the attack surface and controlling traffic
      flow.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new instances may be associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a custom security group with restrictive rules tailored to your application's
      needs.
    - Detach the default security group and attach the custom security group to the
      instances.
