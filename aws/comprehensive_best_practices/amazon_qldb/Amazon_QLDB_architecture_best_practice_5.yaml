    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This best practice helps protect your AWS account
      from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's password
      could gain full access to the account, potentially leading to data breaches
      or resource misuse.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Review each user to ensure that
      MFA is enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices'
      to list all MFA devices and verify their association with users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable
      MFA. 4. Open the 'Security credentials' tab and choose 'Manage MFA device.'
      5. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
