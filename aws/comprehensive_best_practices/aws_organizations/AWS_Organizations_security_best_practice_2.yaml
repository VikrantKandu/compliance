    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unintended
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Public Access' column. 4. For each
      bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the 'Permissions' tab. 5. Verify
      that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab and click on 'Edit' under 'Block public access'. 5. Enable 'Block all public
      access' and save changes.
