    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the buckets.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is critical to maintaining
      data confidentiality and integrity. Public access can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure, data breaches, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for buckets marked as Public.
    - For each public bucket, inspect the bucket permissions and bucket policy to
      identify public access configurations.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket marked as Public.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block public access settings.
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Review the bucket policy and remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Save the changes to enforce private access to the bucket.
