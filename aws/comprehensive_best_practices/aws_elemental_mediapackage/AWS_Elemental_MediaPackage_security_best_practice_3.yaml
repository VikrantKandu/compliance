    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, a malicious actor
      with a user's password can easily gain access to sensitive data and services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA Device" column to verify that an MFA device is
      assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users to list users and
      aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices for each
      user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - Click on the username for which you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" next to the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
