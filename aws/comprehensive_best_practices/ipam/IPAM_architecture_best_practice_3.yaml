    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to
      their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if passwords are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible
      to phishing attacks and other security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the "MFA" column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", click "Manage" and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to enable MFA for users by following the AWS
      documentation on setting up MFA devices.
