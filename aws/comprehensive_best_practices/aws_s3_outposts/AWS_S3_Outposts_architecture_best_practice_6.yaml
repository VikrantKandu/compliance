    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have versioning enabled to
      protect against accidental or malicious data deletion or modification.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps protect data by keeping multiple
      versions of an object, allowing recovery from unintended overwrites and deletions.
      Without versioning, data loss can occur, leading to potential business disruptions
      and data integrity issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check if versioning is enabled by selecting the bucket and
      viewing its properties.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket
        <bucket-name> to verify if versioning is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have versioning enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires versioning.
    - Go to the properties section and enable versioning.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket
        <bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled to enable versioning.
