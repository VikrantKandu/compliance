  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default.
      This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group poses security risks as it allows
      unrestricted access to and from the instances. Custom security groups should
      be used to enforce the principle of least privilege, allowing only necessary
      traffic.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, review
      the associated security groups. 5. Verify that none of the instances are associated
      with the default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if not specified otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored to the
      application requirements. 3. Detach the default security group from the instances.
      4. Attach the newly created security group to the instances.
