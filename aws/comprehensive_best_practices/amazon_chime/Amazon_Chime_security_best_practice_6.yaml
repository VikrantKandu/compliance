  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings on the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
