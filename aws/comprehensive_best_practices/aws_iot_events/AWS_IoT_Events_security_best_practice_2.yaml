    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to the data stored within
      them. This is critical for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
    Rationale: Configuring S3 buckets to be private by default reduces the risk of
      accidental data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches,
      unauthorized access, and potential data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket's ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may vary
      based on user actions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy or ACL.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket to ensure it remains
      private.
