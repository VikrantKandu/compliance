    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA provides an additional layer of protection
      by requiring a second form of verification, which helps prevent unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because the root account
      has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. Without MFA, the
      account is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches,
      resource misuse, and financial loss.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users." 4. Choose the root user account.
      5. Check if the "Multi-Factor Authentication" section indicates that MFA is
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
      2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard. 3. Select "Security credentials." 4. In the
      "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)" section, click "Activate MFA." 5. Follow
      the on-screen instructions to set up and enable MFA using a virtual MFA device
      or hardware MFA device.
