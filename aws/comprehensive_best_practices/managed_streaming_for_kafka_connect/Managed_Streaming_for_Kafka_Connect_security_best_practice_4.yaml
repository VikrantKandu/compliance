    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer of security
      to user accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access by
      requiring a second form of authentication in addition to the password. Without
      MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to compromise, especially if passwords
      are weak or have been exposed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to the 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
