    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private by default minimizes the risk of sensitive
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone on the
      internet, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policies to ensure
      that public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify the bucket's ACL and policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket's ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to apply these changes.
