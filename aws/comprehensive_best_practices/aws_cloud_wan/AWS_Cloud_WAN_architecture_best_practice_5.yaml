    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public reduces the
      risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" on the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to the bucket to authorized users only.
