    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and check for any public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL) to remove public access.
    - Use the S3 block public access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review and monitor bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
