    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Public buckets can be accessed
      by anyone on the internet, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block Public Access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not permit public access.
