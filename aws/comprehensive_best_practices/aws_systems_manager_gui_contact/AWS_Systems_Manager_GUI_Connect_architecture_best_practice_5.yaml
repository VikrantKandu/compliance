    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting bucket
      access to only authorized users minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access at both the
      bucket and account levels.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs for any public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access at the bucket or account level if applicable.
