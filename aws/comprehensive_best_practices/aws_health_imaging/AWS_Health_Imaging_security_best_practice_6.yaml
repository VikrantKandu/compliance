    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps secure sensitive
      data and meet compliance requirements.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest protects it from unauthorized access and helps
      meet regulatory compliance standards. Without encryption, sensitive data stored
      in S3 buckets could be exposed if accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab.
    - Ensure "Default encryption" is enabled and configured with an appropriate encryption
      option (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Enable "Default encryption" and choose an appropriate encryption option (e.g.,
      AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save changes to apply encryption to all new objects stored in the bucket.
