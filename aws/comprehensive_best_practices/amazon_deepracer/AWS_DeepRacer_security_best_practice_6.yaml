    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that the AWS root account has Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate pieces of evidence to authenticate, enhancing
      the security of the root account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is critical because this account
      has unrestricted access to your AWS resources. Without MFA, the root account
      is more vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches,
      resource misuse, or loss of service availability.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the root account from the list.
    - Check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the root account.
    - Under 'Security credentials', choose 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
