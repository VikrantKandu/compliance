    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that no S3 buckets are publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to data leaks and potential
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are
      private by default protects against inadvertent data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, click on Permissions. 4. Check the 'Block all public access'
      settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Review the bucket policy and access
      control list (ACL) to confirm no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets should have 'Block all public access'
      enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console. 2. Click on
      the Permissions tab. 3. Enable 'Block all public access'. 4. Review and update
      the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions. 5. Save the
      changes to apply the new settings.
