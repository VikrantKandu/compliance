    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password. This best practice ensures that all IAM users
      have MFA enabled to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who
      obtains a user's password can gain full access to the user's permissions, potentially
      leading to data breaches or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure that the user successfully configures and verifies the MFA device.
