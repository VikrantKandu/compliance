    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private protects against
      data leaks and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME to programmatically
      check the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME to
      review bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable public access by modifying the bucket ACL and bucket policy.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
