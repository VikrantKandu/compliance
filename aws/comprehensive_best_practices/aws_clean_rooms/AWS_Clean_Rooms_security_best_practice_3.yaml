    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a security risk as they can expose
      sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data
      from unauthorized access and potential misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as Public.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open its properties.
    - Navigate to the Permissions tab and review the Block Public Access settings
      to ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable Block all public access by clicking on the Edit button under Block Public
      Access (bucket settings) and check all options.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
