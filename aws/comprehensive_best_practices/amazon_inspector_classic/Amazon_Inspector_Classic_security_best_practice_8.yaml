    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a code
      from a mobile app, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. If an IAM user's password is compromised, MFA provides an additional
      layer of security, preventing attackers from gaining access without the second
      authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by viewing the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Verify that all users have MFA devices assigned and enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
