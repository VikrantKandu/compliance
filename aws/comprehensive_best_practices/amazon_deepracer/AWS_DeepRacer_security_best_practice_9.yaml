    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and protects sensitive information from being accessed by external
      entities. Publicly accessible buckets have been involved in numerous data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the Access column for public indicators.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on the Permissions tab and review the Block public access settings.
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
