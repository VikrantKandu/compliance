    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that a strong password policy is enabled for AWS IAM users
      to enhance account security. This includes setting minimum password length,
      requiring specific character types, and enforcing password expiration.
    Rationale: A strong password policy helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access by enforcing complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.
      Without a strong password policy, accounts are at risk of being compromised,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings."
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured according to best
      practices, such as a minimum password length of 8 characters, requiring at least
      one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric
      character.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy on IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings."
    - Enable and configure the password policy to meet security best practices, including
      setting a minimum password length and requiring a mix of character types and
      password expiration.
