    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public
      exposure of buckets can lead to data leaks and compromise the confidentiality
      of stored data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Confirm that no bucket has public access settings enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket with public access, review and update the bucket permissions
      to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
