    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      public access unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      data exposure, posing significant security and compliance risks. Restricting
      public access helps protect sensitive information stored in S3 buckets.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket ACL for public access policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access."
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
