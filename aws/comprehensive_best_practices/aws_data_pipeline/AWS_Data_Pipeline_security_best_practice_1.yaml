    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Public exposure can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and configure the "Block public access" settings
      to block all public access.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      they are restricted appropriately.
