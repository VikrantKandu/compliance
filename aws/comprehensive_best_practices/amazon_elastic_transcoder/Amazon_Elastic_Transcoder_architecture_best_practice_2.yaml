    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. This check ensures
      that all S3 buckets have appropriate access controls in place to prevent unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use the
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify the policy status. 6. Confirm that the output indicates the bucket is
      not publicly accessible.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Review and modify the
      bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access. 5. Use the Block Public Access
      settings to prevent public access to the bucket. 6. Save the changes and verify
      the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
