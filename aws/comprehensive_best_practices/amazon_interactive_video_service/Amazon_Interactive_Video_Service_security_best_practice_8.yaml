  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. By default, S3 buckets and objects
      are private, but misconfigurations can lead to public exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
      4. Ensure that no buckets have "Public" access enabled. 5. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings. 6. Check
      the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the
      S3 console. 2. Edit the bucket permissions to remove any public access. 3. Adjust
      the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users or roles. 4. Use
      the Block Public Access feature in S3 to prevent future public access configurations.
