    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring an additional verification method. This practice
      ensures that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is still
      prevented.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, attackers can gain full
      access to the account, leading to data breaches, resource misuse, and potential
      financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      that all users have MFA devices enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, click on "Manage MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
