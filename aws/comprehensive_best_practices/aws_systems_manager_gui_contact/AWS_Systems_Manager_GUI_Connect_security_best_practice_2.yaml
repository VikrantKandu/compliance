    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to unauthorized parties. Public access can lead to data leaks,
      compliance violations, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for public access
      indicators. 4. For each bucket, go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block
      public access' settings. 5. Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled,
      unless there is a justified business need for public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab and click on 'Edit' under 'Block public access'. 4. Enable 'Block all public
      access' and save the changes. 5. If public access is required, ensure that bucket
      policies and IAM policies are configured to allow only the necessary permissions.
