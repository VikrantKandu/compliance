    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to unauthorized data access. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private
      by default helps protect sensitive information and reduces the risk of data
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check for any buckets with 'Public' access in the 'Access' column.
    - Use the 'Permissions' tab to verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any S3 buckets that are publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure that public access is restricted.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
