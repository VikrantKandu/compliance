    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, enhancing the security of the root account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because it prevents unauthorized
      access even if the root account password is compromised. This reduces the risk
      of unauthorized activities and potential breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check if MFA is enabled on the root account.
    - Verify the type of MFA device configured.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
