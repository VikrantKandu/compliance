    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should be launched using the latest Amazon Machine
      Images (AMIs) to ensure they include the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in more recent versions. Keeping AMIs up-to-date reduces the
      risk of security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the AMI ID used by each instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the respective operating
      system.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched using any available AMI, which may not
      be the latest.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the latest AMI for the operating system in use.
    - Plan and execute an update strategy to replace outdated AMIs with the latest
      versions.
    - Consider using automation tools like AWS Systems Manager to streamline the updating
      process.
