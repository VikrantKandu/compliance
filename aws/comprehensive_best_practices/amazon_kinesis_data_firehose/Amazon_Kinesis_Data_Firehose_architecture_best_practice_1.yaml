    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all newly created S3 buckets are private
      by default, preventing unauthorized public access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: By defaulting S3 buckets to private, you minimize the risk of exposing
      sensitive data to the public. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that the Block all public access setting is enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are public by default unless the Block all public access
      setting is enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Step 3: Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Step 4: Enable the Block all public access setting.
    - Step 5: Save changes to ensure the bucket is private.
