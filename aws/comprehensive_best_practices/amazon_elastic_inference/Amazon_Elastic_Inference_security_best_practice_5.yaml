  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. This includes
      preventing both public read and write access to the buckets and objects within
      them to avoid unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access by reviewing the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL).
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any statements that grant public access.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' setting to prevent future public access
      configurations.
