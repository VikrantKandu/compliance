    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets are configured to be private and do not
      allow public access. This is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure the
        ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and remove any public access policies or ACLs.
