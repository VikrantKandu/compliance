    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance types
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance
      types to ensure optimal performance, cost efficiency, and access to the latest
      features.
    Rationale: Using outdated instance types can lead to higher costs, reduced performance,
      and lack of access to new AWS features. The latest instance types are optimized
      for better performance and cost-effectiveness.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances and note their instance types.
    - Compare the instance types with the latest generation types available in the
      AWS EC2 documentation.
    - Identify any instances not using the latest generation types.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest
      generation types unless specified during instance launch.
    Remediation:
    - Review the AWS EC2 documentation for the latest generation instance types.
    - Plan a migration of existing instances to the latest generation types if necessary.
    - Consider using AWS Instance Scheduler or AWS Lambda for automated updates to
      instance types.
    - Ensure that new instances are launched using the latest generation types by
      default.
