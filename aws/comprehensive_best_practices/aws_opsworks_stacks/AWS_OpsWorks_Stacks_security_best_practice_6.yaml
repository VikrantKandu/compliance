    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access or modify data, leading to potential data loss or leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Public' permissions enabled unless absolutely necessary.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure it does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the necessity of this
      access.
    - Remove public access by updating the bucket policy and ACL settings to restrict
      access to authorized users only.
    - Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to modify the bucket's permissions
      accordingly.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
