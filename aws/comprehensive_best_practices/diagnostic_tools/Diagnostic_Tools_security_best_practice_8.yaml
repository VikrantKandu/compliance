    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private and encrypted. S3 buckets should not allow public access and should
      use server-side encryption to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Encryption protects data in the event of unauthorized
      access or data exfiltration.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Public access settings' to ensure that 'Block all
      public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that 'Default encryption' is enabled under the 'Properties' tab for each
      bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but encryption is not enabled.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, enable 'Block all public access' in the
      bucket settings.
    - Enable default encryption by navigating to the 'Properties' tab of the bucket
      and selecting a server-side encryption method (e.g., SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
