    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket access is restricted and not set to public.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to
      check for public access policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket permissions to remove public access.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
