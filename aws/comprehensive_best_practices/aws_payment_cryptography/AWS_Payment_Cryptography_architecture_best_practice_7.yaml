    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: MFA provides an additional layer of security when accessing AWS environments.
      It requires users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the
      protection of sensitive data and resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts
      by requiring a second form of verification. Without MFA, compromised passwords
      can lead to potential data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if 'MFA' is enabled under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA' and follow the instructions to enable MFA.
