    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for the AWS root account to enhance security
      by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account provides an additional layer of security,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, an attacker who gains
      access to the root account credentials could have unrestricted access to all
      AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the status of MFA for the root account under the "Security Status" section.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console using the root account.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - Under "Security Status," find the prompt to enable MFA for the root account.
    - Follow the instructions to set up and enable MFA using a virtual MFA device
      or hardware MFA device.
