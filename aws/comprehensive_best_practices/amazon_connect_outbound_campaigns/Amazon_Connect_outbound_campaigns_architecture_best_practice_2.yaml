    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should be configured
      to only allow access to trusted entities.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By restricting access, organizations can prevent
      data leaks and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME to check
      ACL settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public-read or public-read-write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket ACLs to remove public permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configuration.
