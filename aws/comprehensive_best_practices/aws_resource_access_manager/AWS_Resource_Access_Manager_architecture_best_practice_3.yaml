    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to data. Public buckets can be exploited by malicious users,
      leading to potential data leaks and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the bucket
        policy and ACL settings.
    - Step 5: Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to verify that public access
        is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Action 3: For each bucket, review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
        public access.
    - Action 4: Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Action 5: Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
