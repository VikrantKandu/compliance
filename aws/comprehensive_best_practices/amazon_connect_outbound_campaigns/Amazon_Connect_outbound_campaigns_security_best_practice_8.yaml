    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for the AWS root account to add an extra
      layer of security. MFA requires users to provide a second form of authentication,
      enhancing the security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full control over the AWS account, leading to potential
      data loss, service disruption, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users" and then "Security credentials".
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Verify that the MFA device is activated and linked to the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and then "Security credentials".
    - Under "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)", choose "Activate MFA".
    - Follow the instructions to set up and activate MFA using a virtual MFA device
      or a hardware MFA device.
