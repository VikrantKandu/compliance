    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to provide a
      complete log of all account activity. This is crucial for auditing and compliance
      purposes as it records all actions taken by users, roles, or AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that you have a comprehensive
      record of AWS API calls made in your account. This is important for security
      analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. Without CloudTrail
      enabled, there is a risk of unauthorized activity going undetected.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail dashboard.
    - Verify that CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.
    - Check that the trails are logging to a secure S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that log file validation is enabled for integrity verification.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS CloudTrail console.
    - Create a new trail or update an existing trail to include all regions.
    - Configure the trail to log to a secure S3 bucket with proper permissions.
    - Enable log file validation to ensure the integrity of the logs.
