    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an additional layer of security by
      requiring a second form of verification. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, even if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - Check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
