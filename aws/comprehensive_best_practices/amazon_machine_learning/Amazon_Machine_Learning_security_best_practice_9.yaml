    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading to data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring S3 buckets are private mitigates the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Ensure no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - In the "Permissions" tab, enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
