    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
        <bucket-name> to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" feature to prevent future public access
      configurations.
