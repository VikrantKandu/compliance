    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      public access unless explicitly required for use cases like static website hosting.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of sensitive data being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no policies granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' option.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
