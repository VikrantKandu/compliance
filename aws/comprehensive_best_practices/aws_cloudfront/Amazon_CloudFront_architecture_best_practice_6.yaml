    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can expose data to the internet, which can lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized users to access and potentially modify data. Ensuring
      buckets are private by default protects sensitive information and complies with
      data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to programmatically check the permissions of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and remove any public access granted in the bucket
      policy or ACL.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
