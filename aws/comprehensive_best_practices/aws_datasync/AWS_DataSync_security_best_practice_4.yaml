    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security beyond just a username
      and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to the AWS account. Without MFA, if the root account credentials
      are compromised, an attacker can gain full access to all AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM dashboard. 3. Check the Security Status section to see if MFA is
      enabled on the root account. 4. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam
      get-account-summary and verify that AccountMFAEnabled is true.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled on the root account by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM dashboard. 3. In the Security Status section, click on "Activate
      MFA on your root account." 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable MFA,
      choosing either a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
