  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have encryption enabled
      at rest to protect data stored in the cloud from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets protects sensitive data from being
      accessed by unauthorized users. Without encryption, data at rest is vulnerable
      to breaches and unauthorized access, potentially leading to data loss or exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check the Default encryption section to verify that server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have encryption enabled.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable Default encryption.
    - Choose the desired encryption option, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
