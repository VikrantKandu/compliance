    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by requiring additional
      authentication factors, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access
      AWS accounts even if they have compromised the password. Not enabling MFA increases
      the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the Security
      credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the IAM console
      at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users.
      4. Select the user you want to enable MFA for. 5. Choose the Security credentials
      tab, and then choose Manage MFA. 6. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable
      a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
