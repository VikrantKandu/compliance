    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be launched in the default VPC. The default
      VPC is created automatically by AWS and comes with default configurations that
      might not meet the security and compliance requirements of your organization.
      By using a custom VPC, you can enforce stricter security controls and network
      configurations.
    Rationale: Using the default VPC can expose your instances to unnecessary risks
      due to its default configurations. Custom VPCs allow for more granular control
      over security groups, network ACLs, and routing, reducing the attack surface
      and improving network security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Under "Instances," check the VPC ID for each instance.
    - Verify that no instances are using the default VPC (VPC ID starting with "vpc-").
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,VpcId]'`
      to list all instances and their VPC IDs.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC unless
      specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running in the default VPC.
    - Plan and execute the migration of these instances to a custom VPC.
    - Update instance launch configurations and templates to use the custom VPC.
    - Ensure that all future instances are launched in the custom VPC by setting the
      appropriate configurations in your deployment scripts and tools.
