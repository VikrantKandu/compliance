    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users are
      configured with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security by requiring
      an additional authentication factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of passwords.
      If a user's password is compromised, MFA helps prevent unauthorized access to
      AWS resources. Not using MFA increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users.'
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users.'
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device,' choose 'Manage.'
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
