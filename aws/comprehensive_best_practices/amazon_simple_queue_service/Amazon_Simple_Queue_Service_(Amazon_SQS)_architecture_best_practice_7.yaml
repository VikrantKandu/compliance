    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access,
      and data leaks. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default helps protect
      sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Restricting access to
      only authorized users or applications reduces the risk of data breaches and
      ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME and verify
      that the ACL does not grant public access.
    - Check bucket policies using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME
      to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Review and remove any public access permissions in the bucket ACL and bucket
      policy.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
