    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA
      device' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7.
      Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
