    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring not only a password but also a second factor,
      such as a text message or authentication app code. This significantly reduces
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is crucial as it protects against compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen or guessed, an attacker
      could gain full access to the AWS account, potentially leading to data breaches
      or unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
