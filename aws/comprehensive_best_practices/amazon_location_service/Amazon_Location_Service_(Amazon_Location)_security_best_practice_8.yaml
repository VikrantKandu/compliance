    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS accounts by requiring not only a password and username but also
      something that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile
      app. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS resources and sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Without MFA, users are more vulnerable to credential
      theft and unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and security
      incidents.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Review each user to verify that
      'MFA' is enabled in the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. In the 'Security Credentials' tab, click 'Manage
      MFA'. 6. Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device to the user.
