    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to sensitive data being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches. Unauthorized
      users can access sensitive information, leading to potential data loss, compliance
      violations, and reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the Permissions tab. 4. Check the Block Public
      Access settings and ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify that the bucket policy
      does not grant public access. 6. Ensure that the Access Control List (ACL) does
      not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Enable Block Public Access for the bucket in the Permissions tab.
      2. Update the bucket policy to remove any statements allowing public access.
      3. Modify the ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
