    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access, even if the password is compromised. This is crucial in preventing unauthorized
      actions and potential data breaches within your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
