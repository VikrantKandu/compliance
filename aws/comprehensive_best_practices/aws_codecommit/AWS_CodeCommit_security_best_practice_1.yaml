    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure and
      potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Check bucket policies for statements allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Update the bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable the 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
