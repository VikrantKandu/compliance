    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block all public access' setting for each bucket.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and revise any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
