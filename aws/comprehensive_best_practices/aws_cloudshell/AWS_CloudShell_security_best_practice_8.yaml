    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly intended. Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and accidental data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the access status. 4. Verify that no
      bucket has public access enabled unless required. 5. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check the ACL settings. 6.
      Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that should not be publicly accessible. 4. Click on the
      "Permissions" tab. 5. Review and remove any public access permissions in the
      bucket policy and ACL. 6. Enable "Block all public access" settings if necessary.
