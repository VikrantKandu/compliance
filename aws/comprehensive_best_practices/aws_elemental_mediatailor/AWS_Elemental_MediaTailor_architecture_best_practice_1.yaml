    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. It requires users to provide a second form
      of identification, such as a code from their mobile phone, to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. If a password is compromised, MFA acts as a second line of
      defense, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled by looking for 'MFA Device' in the user's detail page.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. On the user's detail page, choose 'Security
      credentials'. 6. Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the
      steps to assign an MFA device to the user.
