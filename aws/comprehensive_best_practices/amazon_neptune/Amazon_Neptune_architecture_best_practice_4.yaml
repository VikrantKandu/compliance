    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access, data
      breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure public access is
        blocked.
    - Step 5: Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they
        do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable "Block all public access" on all S3 buckets.
    - Action 2: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access
        permissions.
    - Action 3: Use the AWS CLI or SDKs to automate the enforcement of public access
        restrictions.
