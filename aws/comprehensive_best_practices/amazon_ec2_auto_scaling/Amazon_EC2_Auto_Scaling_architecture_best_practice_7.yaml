    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to sensitive data exposure and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with data protection
      regulations. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the "Public access" column for any buckets
      marked as "Public". 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the
      "Permissions" tab. 5. Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
      6. Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public
      access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block
      all public access". 4. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      any public access permissions. 5. Save the changes to apply the new access settings.
