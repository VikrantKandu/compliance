    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Public access
      to S3 buckets should be restricted unless explicitly required for a specific
      use case.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces
      the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public
      access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access permissions securely.
