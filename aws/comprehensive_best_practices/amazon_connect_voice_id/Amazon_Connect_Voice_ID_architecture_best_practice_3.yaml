    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security beyond just
      a username and password. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions within
      your AWS environment.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      'aws iam list-users' followed by 'aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>'
      to programmatically check for MFA devices associated with each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Assigned
      MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware
      MFA device to the user. 8. Instruct the user to configure their MFA device using
      the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
