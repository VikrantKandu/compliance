    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest protects it from unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each S3 bucket and check the "Default encryption" setting under the "Properties"
      tab.
    - Ensure that server-side encryption is enabled with either AWS-KMS or AES-256.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption".
    - Choose the encryption method, either AWS-KMS or AES-256, to encrypt the bucket.
