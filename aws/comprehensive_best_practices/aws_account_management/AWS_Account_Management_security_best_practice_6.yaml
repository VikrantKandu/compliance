    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance account security. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to present two or more pieces of evidence (factors) to authenticate.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Check the "MFA" column for each
      user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In the
      "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device to the user.
