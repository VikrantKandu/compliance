  Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  Profile Applicability: Level 1
  Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
    for all IAM users in an AWS account. MFA provides an additional layer of security
    by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a one-time
    password, in addition to their standard credentials.
  Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
    access to AWS resources, even if a user's password is compromised. Without MFA,
    an attacker could potentially gain full access to an account with just a single
    factor of authentication.
  Audit:
  - Log into the AWS Management Console.
  - Navigate to the IAM service.
  - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
  - Review the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
  Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
  Remediation:
  - Log into the AWS Management Console.
  - Navigate to the IAM service.
  - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
  - Choose 'Security credentials' and select 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
  - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
