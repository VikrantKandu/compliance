    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is critical to protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public access can
      lead to data exposure, compliance violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs grant
      public read or write access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure public access is blocked for
      all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any
      public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for all buckets to prevent future
      public access.
