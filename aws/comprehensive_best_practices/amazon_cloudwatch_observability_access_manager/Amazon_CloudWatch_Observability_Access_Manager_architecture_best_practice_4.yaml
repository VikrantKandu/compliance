    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Accounts
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on all AWS
      accounts to enhance security by requiring an additional verification step during
      sign-in.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. It helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS accounts, reducing
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized changes to resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.
    - Select 'Users' and review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
      verify that all users have MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on AWS accounts.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on 'Security credentials' and then 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
