    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. It requires users to provide a second form
      of authentication, which enhances security by ensuring that the person attempting
      to access an account is who they claim to be.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a recommended security practice. It protects
      against compromised passwords and unauthorized access. Without MFA, accounts
      are vulnerable to phishing attacks, password theft, and other security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
