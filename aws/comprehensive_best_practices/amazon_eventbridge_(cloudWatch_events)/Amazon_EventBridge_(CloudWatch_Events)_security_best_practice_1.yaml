    Title: Enable Versioning on S3 Buckets
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that versioning is enabled on all S3 buckets to protect against
      accidental or malicious deletion or modification of objects. Versioning allows
      you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored
      in your buckets.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets is crucial for data protection and
      recovery. It helps in recovering from accidental overwrites, deletions, and
      provides a way to revert to previous versions of objects. Without versioning,
      there is a risk of permanent data loss.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the Properties tab. 4. Verify that the Versioning
      status is set to Enabled.
    Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default on S3 buckets.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket for which you want to enable versioning. 4. Go to the Properties
      tab. 5. Click on the Versioning section and select Enable versioning. 6. Save
      the changes.
