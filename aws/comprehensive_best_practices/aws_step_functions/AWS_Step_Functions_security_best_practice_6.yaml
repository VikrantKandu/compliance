    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to present two or more separate forms of identification during
      the sign-in process.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all MFA devices and verify their association with users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select "Users."
    - For each user without MFA, click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," choose "Manage" and follow the steps to activate
      MFA.
    - Consider using policies to enforce MFA usage for all users.
