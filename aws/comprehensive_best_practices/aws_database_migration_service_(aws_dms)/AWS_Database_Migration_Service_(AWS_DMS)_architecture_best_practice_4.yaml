    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive information to the internet, leading to potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial for data security. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and potential data leaks, which
      can have severe consequences for an organization's reputation and compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
