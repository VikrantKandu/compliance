    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group to ensure a more restrictive and customized security posture.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can pose a security risk by exposing instances to unnecessary network
      access. Custom security groups should be used to adhere to the principle of
      least privilege.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" and review each instance's associated security groups.
    - Ensure no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with more restrictive rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
