    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA provides an extra layer of security for AWS accounts by requiring
      not only a password but also a second factor, such as a physical device, to
      authenticate users. This helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised accounts, especially in
      scenarios where passwords are weak or have been leaked. Without MFA, unauthorized
      users can gain access to sensitive resources if they obtain user credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      verify all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
    - Repeat for all users who do not have MFA enabled.
