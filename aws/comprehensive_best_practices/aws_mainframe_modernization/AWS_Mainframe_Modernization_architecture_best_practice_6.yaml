    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      thereby preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and information leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default reduces the risk of accidental exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy allowing public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
