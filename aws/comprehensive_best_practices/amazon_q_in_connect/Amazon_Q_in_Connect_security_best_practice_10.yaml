    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by requiring
      an additional authentication factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
