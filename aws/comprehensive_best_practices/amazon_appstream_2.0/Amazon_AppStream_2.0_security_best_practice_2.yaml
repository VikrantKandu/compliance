    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a password policy is enabled for AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) users. A strong password policy helps to protect
      user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling a password policy in IAM reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by enforcing strong password requirements. Without a password policy,
      users may set weak passwords that are easily compromised, leading to potential
      security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account settings' from the left pane.
    - Verify that a password policy is set and that it meets the organization's security
      requirements.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Account settings' from the left pane.
    - Click on 'Set password policy'.
    - Configure the password policy to enforce strong passwords, including length,
      complexity, and expiration requirements.
    - Save the changes to apply the password policy.
