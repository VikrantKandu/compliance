    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data leaks or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to
      ensure that they do not grant public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to verify that it is enabled for the bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy and aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl to review policies and ACLs for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console to enable Block Public Access settings for the
      bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to
      manage access to the bucket.
