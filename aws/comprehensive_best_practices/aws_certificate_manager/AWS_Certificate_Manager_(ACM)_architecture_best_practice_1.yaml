    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption provides data protection
      by encrypting the data before it is stored and decrypting it when it is accessed.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data and meets
      compliance requirements. Without encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and significant financial
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select each S3 bucket to review.
    - Check the "Default encryption" setting under the "Properties" tab.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled (either AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the S3 bucket that does not have server-side encryption enabled.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption," choose "Edit."
    - Select "Enable" for server-side encryption.
    - Choose the encryption type (AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes.
