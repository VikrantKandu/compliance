    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure, posing significant security risks. Ensuring buckets are private
      protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have a policy that allows public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket policies and verify no public access is
      granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
