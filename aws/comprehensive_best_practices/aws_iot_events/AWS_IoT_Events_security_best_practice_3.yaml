    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches as unauthorized
      users may access or manipulate sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled via bucket policies or ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Consider using Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
