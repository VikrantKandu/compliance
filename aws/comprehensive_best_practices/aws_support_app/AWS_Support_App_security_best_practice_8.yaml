    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top
      of a username and password, requiring users to provide a unique authentication
      code from a physical device or mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. If a user's password is compromised, MFA acts as a second
      line of defense. Without MFA, attackers can easily exploit compromised credentials,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to resources.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left pane, click on 'Users'. 4. For each user, check if MFA is enabled
      by verifying the presence of an MFA device. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left pane, click on 'Users' and select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 4. Click on the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. In the 'Assigned
      MFA device' section, click 'Manage'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign a virtual
      or hardware MFA device to the user.
