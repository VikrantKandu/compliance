    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps
      protect data from unauthorized access by encrypting it when it is stored in
      the bucket.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest is a critical security measure to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. If server-side encryption is not enabled, data
      stored in S3 buckets could be accessible to unauthorized users, leading to data
      breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's properties to ensure that server-side encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to verify encryption settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the Properties tab, and under Default encryption, select Enable.
    - Choose the encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) and save the changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration <configuration> to enable
      encryption programmatically.
