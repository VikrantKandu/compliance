    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance types
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance
      types to ensure optimal performance, security, and cost-efficiency. Using outdated
      instance types can lead to decreased performance and increased costs.
    Rationale: Latest generation instance types provide better performance and security
      features. They are often more cost-effective and receive better support from
      AWS. Using older generations can expose your infrastructure to vulnerabilities
      and inefficiencies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running instances and their instance types.
    - Compare the instance types with the latest generation types available in the
      AWS EC2 documentation.
    - Identify any instances that are not using the latest generation types.
    Default Value: Instances are not automatically updated to the latest generation
      types.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated instance types.
    - Plan a migration to the latest generation instance types.
    - Use AWS tools such as AWS Migration Hub or AWS Systems Manager to assist in
      the migration process.
    - Test the new instance types in a staging environment before full migration.
    - Monitor performance and cost after migration to ensure improvements.
