    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for your AWS environment by requiring an additional form of verification beyond
      just a password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, a malicious actor
      could potentially access sensitive data or services if they obtain a user's
      password.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    - Confirm that each user has a device listed under 'Assigned MFA device'.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
