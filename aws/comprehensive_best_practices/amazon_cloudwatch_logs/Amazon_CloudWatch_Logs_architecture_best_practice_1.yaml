  - Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is important to restrict
      public access to prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the internet.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      public helps protect data and meet security and compliance requirements.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Check the "Block Public
      Access" settings for each bucket to ensure public access is blocked. 5. Use
      the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs for public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check bucket policies for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab and
      select "Block Public Access". 5. Enable all options to block public access and
      save changes. 6. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public
      access permissions. 7. Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to
      restrict public access.
