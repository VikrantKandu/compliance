    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security beyond just a username and
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the AWS root account significantly reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain full control over the AWS environment, leading to potential
      data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user with administrative
      privileges. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane,
      choose 'Dashboard'. 4. Under 'Security Status', check the status of MFA on the
      root account. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. In the 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)' section, choose 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions
      to configure a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device. 5. Complete the setup
      by verifying the MFA device and enabling it for the root account.
