    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS accounts by requiring not only a password and username but also
      something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only
      they should know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources, thereby enhancing overall account
      security.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the IAM Dashboard, select 'Users'. 4. Review each user to check if MFA
      is enabled. 5. Confirm that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
      4. In the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA'. 5. Follow the prompts
      to enable MFA for the user.
