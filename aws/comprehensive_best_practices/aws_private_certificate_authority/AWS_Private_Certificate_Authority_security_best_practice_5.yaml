    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing
      a security risk. Ensuring that buckets are private helps protect sensitive information
      from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket does not allow public access by checking the "Block all
      public access" setting.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
