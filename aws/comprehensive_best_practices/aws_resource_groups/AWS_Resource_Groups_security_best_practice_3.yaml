    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not use the default security group. The default
      security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which can lead to potential
      security risks.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      and potentially harmful network traffic. By ensuring that EC2 instances are
      associated with a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules,
      you can reduce the attack surface and enhance security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that the security group is not the default one.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched using the default security
      group, which allows all traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per
      your security requirements.
    - Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Remove the instances from the default security group to ensure compliance.
