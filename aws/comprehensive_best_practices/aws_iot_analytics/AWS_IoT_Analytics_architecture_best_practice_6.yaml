    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Private S3 buckets prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
      Public buckets can expose sensitive information and lead to compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure they are not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check for any bucket policy that grants public access using aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - For each bucket that is publicly accessible, remove public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
