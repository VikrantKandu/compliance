    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase
      the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public
      access settings are enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Remove any public access statements from the bucket policy.
    - Review and adjust bucket ACLs to restrict public access.
