    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict public
      access to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are private helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column to identify
        publicly accessible buckets.
    - Step 4: For each bucket, click on the bucket name and navigate to the "Permissions"
        tab.
    - Step 5: Verify that the bucket does not have any public access policies or ACLs
        that allow public read/write access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and not accessible
      to the public.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: For any bucket found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the "Permissions"
        tab.
    - Step 2: Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Step 3: Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Step 4: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to grant access
        only to authorized users or roles.
