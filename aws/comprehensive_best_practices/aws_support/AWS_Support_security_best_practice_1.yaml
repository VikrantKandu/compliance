    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      information to the internet, leading to compliance violations and security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the Access Control List (ACL) settings and bucket policies for each S3
      bucket.
    - Verify that all buckets have the "Block all public access" setting enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket that is not private, go to the permissions tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting to ensure the bucket is private.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access only to authorized
      users.
