  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide an additional authentication factor
      beyond the standard username and password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if credentials are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks such as phishing or credential stuffing, potentially leading to unauthorized
      access to AWS resources.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select Users from the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled by reviewing the Security Credentials tab. 5. Verify that all users
      have MFA devices assigned.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select Users from the navigation pane. 4. For each user without MFA, click
      on the user name to open the user details page. 5. Click on the Security Credentials
      tab. 6. Under Assigned MFA device, click Manage. 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device to the user.
