    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised accounts
      due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, unauthorized users may gain
      access to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized
      actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select Users.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device to
      the user.
