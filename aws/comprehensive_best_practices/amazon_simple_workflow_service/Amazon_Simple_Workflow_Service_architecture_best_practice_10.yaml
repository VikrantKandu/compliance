    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of
      security for IAM users by requiring a second form of authentication. This ensures
      that even if a user's password is compromised, the account remains secure.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to security
      breaches, data loss, and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user to open their details.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device for the user.
