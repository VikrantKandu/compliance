    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account provides additional security by requiring
      a second form of authentication. Without MFA, the root account is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, which can lead to potential data breaches or misuse
      of resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity
      and Access Management) dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
      4. Select the root account. 5. Check if MFA is enabled under the 'Security credentials'
      tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      (Identity and Access Management) dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose
      'Dashboard'. 4. Under 'Security Status', choose 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
      5. Follow the instructions to enable MFA, using either a virtual MFA device
      or a hardware MFA device.
