    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Restricting access to only authorized
      users mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket to ensure they are not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, accessible only by the bucket
      owner.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket permissions.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure no public access is granted.
