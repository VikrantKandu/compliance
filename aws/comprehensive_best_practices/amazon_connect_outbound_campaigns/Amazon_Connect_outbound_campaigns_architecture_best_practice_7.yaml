  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that no bucket is configured to
      allow public access unless explicitly intended.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. This check helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity by ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List" (ACL)
      settings to ensure they do not allow public access. 4. Use the "Block Public
      Access" settings to verify that public access is restricted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the bucket
      policy and ACL settings. 2. Remove any statements that allow public access unless
      explicitly required. 3. Enable "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future
      unauthorized public access.
