    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unintentional exposure of sensitive
      data to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a security risk as they can expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME to verify
      bucket ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME to check
      bucket policy for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and disable public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Ensure the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
