    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets poses a significant security risk, as it
      can allow unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete sensitive data. Restricting
      public access helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled by checking the "Block
      all public access" setting.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If public access is enabled, go to the S3 bucket settings.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
