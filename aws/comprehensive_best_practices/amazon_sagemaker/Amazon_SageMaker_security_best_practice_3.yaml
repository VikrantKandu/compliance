    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading to data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure.
      Ensuring S3 buckets are private by default protects against unauthorized access
      and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not granted
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings for any public access configurations.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
