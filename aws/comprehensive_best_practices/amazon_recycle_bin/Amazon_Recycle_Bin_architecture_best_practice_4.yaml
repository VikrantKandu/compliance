    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to unauthorized access and data leaks. Restricting public access helps
      protect data from unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify buckets with public access indicators.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs)
      to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to programmatically verify
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to check for policies that
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable public access settings if enabled.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
