    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone over the internet. This can lead to data leaks
      and potential compliance violations if sensitive information is exposed.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions and ensure that
      'Block all public access' settings are enabled. 5. Verify that there are no
      bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have all public access blocked unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Edit the bucket permissions to block
      all public access. 4. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
      5. Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
