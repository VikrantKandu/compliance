    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an extra layer
      of security. MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors
      to gain access to AWS resources, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to AWS resources. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a time-based
      one-time password (TOTP) or a hardware device.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and review each user to check the 'MFA' column.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically check MFA
      status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to activate MFA, which may include scanning a QR code with
      a mobile app or registering a hardware MFA device.
