    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all newly created S3 buckets are private
      by default, which prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the
      cloud.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets should be private to prevent unauthorized access.
      Public buckets can expose sensitive data, leading to data breaches and compliance
      violations. Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of accidental
      exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the default bucket settings for new buckets.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled by default for
      all new buckets.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are public by default unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the bucket.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is private.
