    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized public access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this
      risk by restricting access to only authorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
