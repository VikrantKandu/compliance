    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public read or write
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      data manipulation, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and review the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent public access.
    - Review bucket policies and ACLs to remove any statements allowing public access.
