    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps maintain data
      privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policy and permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have any policies or permissions that allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or permissions that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and permissions to ensure compliance.
