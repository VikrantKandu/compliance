    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to
      their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, unauthorized users
      could gain access to AWS resources, leading to potential security breaches and
      data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' in the 'Assigned MFA device' section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
