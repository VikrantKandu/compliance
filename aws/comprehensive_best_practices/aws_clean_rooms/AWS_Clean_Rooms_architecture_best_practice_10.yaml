    Title: Ensure that EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check to ensure that EC2 instances are not associated with the default
      security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound access, which
      can expose instances to potential attacks.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to security vulnerabilities
      because they typically allow unrestricted inbound traffic. This can expose the
      instances to unauthorized access and potential attacks, compromising data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security groups' column.
    - Verify that none of the instances are associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group if no specific security group is chosen.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your application needs.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances currently using the default
      one.
    - Remove the default security group from these instances.
