    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access. Public accessibility can expose instances to
      potential threats and vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to EC2 instances reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible instances can be targeted
      by attackers, leading to data loss or service disruption.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Check the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no security group allows inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 on any port
      that should not be publicly accessible.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 security groups do not allow inbound traffic from
      the internet.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the security group associated with the publicly accessible EC2 instance.
    - Edit the inbound rules to restrict access by removing any rules allowing traffic
      from 0.0.0.0/0.
    - Implement more restrictive rules that only allow access from trusted IP addresses
      or networks.
