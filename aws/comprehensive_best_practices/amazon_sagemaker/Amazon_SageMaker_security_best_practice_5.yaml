    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data from being exposed to unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
