  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches and
      unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private by default mitigates
      these risks and ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' section.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public access.
  - Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked.
  - Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the specific bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Save changes and verify the settings to ensure compliance.
