    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      increasing the risk of data theft, unauthorized access, and data leakage. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality and
      integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket and ensure all public
      access is blocked.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and access the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for more granular access
      control.
