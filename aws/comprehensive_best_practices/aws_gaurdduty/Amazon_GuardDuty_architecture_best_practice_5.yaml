    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication, typically a temporary code generated
      by a mobile app or hardware token, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized
      changes or access to sensitive data. MFA significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" to list all IAM users. 4. For each
      user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically
      check MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" to list all IAM users. 4.
      Select a user and go to the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Click on "Manage
      MFA device" and follow the instructions to enable and configure MFA for the
      user. 6. Repeat the process for all IAM users who do not have MFA enabled.
