    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access helps safeguard data against unauthorized users.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block
      public access" settings to ensure all options are enabled. 5. Review the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public access permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" on the bucket settings. 2. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
