    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Restricting public access ensures that only intended users can
      access the data, protecting sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or access control
      lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify the settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Consider enabling the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future changes
      that could make the bucket public.
