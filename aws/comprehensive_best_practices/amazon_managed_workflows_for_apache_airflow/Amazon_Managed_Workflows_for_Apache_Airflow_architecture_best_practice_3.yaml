    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible
      buckets can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      increasing the risk of data breaches, data theft, and non-compliance with data
      protection regulations. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to access its properties.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure there are no
      public access permissions.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new settings.
