    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are set to private to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless
      explicitly required and approved.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes
      the risk of data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the bucket to private.
    - Review and update any bucket policies that may allow public access.
