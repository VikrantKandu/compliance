    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of protection on top of a password, making it significantly harder for unauthorized
      users to access your AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      full access to the user's permissions. MFA reduces this risk by requiring an
      additional verification method.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check whether 'MFA' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select a user to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
