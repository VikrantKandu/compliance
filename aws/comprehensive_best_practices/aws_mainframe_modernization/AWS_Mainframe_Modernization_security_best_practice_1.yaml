    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Default security groups allow unrestricted inbound and
      outbound traffic, which may lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can expose instances to unnecessary risk
      by allowing unrestricted traffic. Custom security groups should be used to define
      specific inbound and outbound rules, minimizing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the default security group association from the instances.
