- rule:
  - ID: AWS-BP-001
  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has access to, such as a physical token or a mobile app.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, unauthorized access to AWS resources is more likely
      if a password is stolen or guessed. MFA helps protect against unauthorized access
      by requiring an additional form of authentication.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the Security
      credentials tab. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the
      status under the Assigned MFA device.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. Under the Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA) section, choose Manage. 7. Follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device to the user.
