    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access if not properly controlled.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      by default minimizes the risk of exposing data unintentionally.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions of each bucket to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public
      access is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block all public access at the account
      level or individual bucket level.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with
      security best practices.
