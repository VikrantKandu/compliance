    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      especially in the event of compromised passwords. Without MFA, accounts are
      more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing and brute force, which can lead
      to unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list all users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
