    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of AWS accounts by requiring users
      to provide an extra form of verification. Without MFA, if a user's credentials
      are compromised, an attacker could gain full access to the account, leading
      to potential data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled by verifying the presence of an
      MFA device.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, click on Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
