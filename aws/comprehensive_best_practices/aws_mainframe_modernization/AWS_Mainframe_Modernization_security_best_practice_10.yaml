    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      without appropriate permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default helps
      protect data integrity and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no
        public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access must be explicitly
      granted.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Action 2: Review and update bucket policies to remove any public access permissions.
    - Action 3: Modify access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Action 4: Regularly audit bucket permissions to maintain compliance.
