    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and should be avoided
      unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting access to only authorized
      users helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have 'Public Access' enabled and that the bucket
      policies do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Disable 'Block all public access' if it is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove any public access policies with aws s3api delete-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
