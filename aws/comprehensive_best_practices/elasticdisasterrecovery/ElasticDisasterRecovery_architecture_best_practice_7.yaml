    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the stored data. This can lead to
      data leaks, compliance violations, and potential financial and reputational
      damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that
      no buckets are publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public permissions
      from the bucket ACLs and bucket policies.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings to ensure
      it is not publicly accessible.
    - Implement AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
