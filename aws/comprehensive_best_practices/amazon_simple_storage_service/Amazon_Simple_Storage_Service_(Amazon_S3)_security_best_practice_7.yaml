    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. It is crucial to restrict access
      to only authorized users and applications.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Check the 'Block public
      access' settings and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Review
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do not allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab and enable 'Block all public access'. 5. Review and modify bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
