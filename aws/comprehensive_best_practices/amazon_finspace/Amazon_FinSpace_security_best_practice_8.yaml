    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket's access control list (ACL) and bucket policy do not
      grant public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify ACL and bucket policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the bucket
      and account level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and access logs to ensure compliance.
