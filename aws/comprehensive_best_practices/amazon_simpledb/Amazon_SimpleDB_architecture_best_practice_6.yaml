    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of the username and password by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account helps prevent unauthorized access
      to the account. Without MFA, if the root account credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full control over the AWS environment, leading to potential
      data breaches and resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Check the 'Security Status' section.
    - Verify that the root account has MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the 'Security Status' section, click on 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to set up and enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware
      MFA device.
