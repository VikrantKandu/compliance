  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public access unless explicitly
      required for business purposes. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, resulting in data breaches and compliance issues. Restricting access
      helps in maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs). 4. Ensure
      that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select the
      "Permissions" tab. 3. Click on "Block public access" and ensure all options
      are checked. 4. Save changes to apply the new settings.
