    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are not public helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove public access permissions if necessary.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
