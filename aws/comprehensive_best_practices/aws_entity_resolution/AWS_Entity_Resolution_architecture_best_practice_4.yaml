    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      by default. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can allow unauthorized users to read or write data. This can result in
      data breaches, data loss, or data corruption.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and the bucket policy.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions set.
    - Use the Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket permissions and policies to remove public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
