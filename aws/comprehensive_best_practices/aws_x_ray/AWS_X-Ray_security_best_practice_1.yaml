    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data and increase the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data exposure. Limiting access to only necessary users and applications reduces
      the risk of data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
      Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
      Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
      Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
      Step 4: Ensure that the bucket does not have public read or write permissions
        unless explicitly required.
      Step 5: Use the AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically check bucket policies and
        ACLs for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
      Step 1: Identify buckets that are publicly accessible.
      Step 2: Update the bucket policy to remove public read/write permissions.
      Step 3: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK to modify bucket ACLs and
        policies to restrict access.
      Step 4: Implement S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
