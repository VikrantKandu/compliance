    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can be restricted
      by configuring bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) appropriately.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not public by default minimizes
      the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the Amazon S3 console.
    - In the Buckets list, review the Public access column for each bucket.
    - For buckets marked as Public, evaluate the bucket policy and ACLs to confirm
      if they are intended to be public.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL configuration.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not allowed
      unless explicitly configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the Amazon S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on Permissions and review the Bucket Policy and Access Control List (ACL).
    - Remove any statements in the bucket policy that allow public access.
    - Adjust the ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Consider enabling Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings for additional protection.
