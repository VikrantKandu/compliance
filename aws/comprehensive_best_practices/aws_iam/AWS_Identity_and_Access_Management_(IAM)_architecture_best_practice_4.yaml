    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of protection on top of a user name and password, requiring users to provide
      a unique authentication code from their MFA device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by requiring a second
      form of authentication. This reduces the risk of account compromise due to stolen
      or guessed passwords. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to list users and their MFA status with the command: aws
        iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' and aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
        <username>.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device for
      the user.
