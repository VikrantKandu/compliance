    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access unless
      explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and
      lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are not public by default minimizes the risk of data
      leakage and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
