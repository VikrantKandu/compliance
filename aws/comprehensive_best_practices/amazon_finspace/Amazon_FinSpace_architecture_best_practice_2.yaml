  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is important to restrict access
      to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets and ensure that only authorized users
      or applications can access the data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps prevent potential data leaks and unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions of each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL) do not grant public access. 5. Use the "Block Public
      Access" settings to restrict public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
      2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Review and modify the bucket
      policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable "Block Public
      Access" settings for the bucket. 5. Test the bucket to ensure it is no longer
      publicly accessible.
