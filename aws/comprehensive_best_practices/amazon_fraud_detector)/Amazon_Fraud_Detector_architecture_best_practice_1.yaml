    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect
      your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: MFA helps to prevent unauthorized access to AWS accounts by requiring
      additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
