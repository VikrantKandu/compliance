    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and pose a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data exposure and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that no public access is
      granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check bucket policies using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure they don't allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and do not allow
      public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket ACL to remove any public grants.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets
      to prevent public access.
