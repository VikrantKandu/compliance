    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps protect sensitive information and comply with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS Config or AWS Trusted Advisor to identify publicly accessible buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the ACLs to remove public permissions.
    - Enable bucket-level settings to block public access.
