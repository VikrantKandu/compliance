    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
      It's crucial to configure bucket policies and access controls to prevent unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      data access. By restricting public access, you mitigate the risk of exposing
      sensitive information to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets.
    - For each bucket, check the "Access" column to see if it is publicly accessible.
    - Click on each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not grant public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
