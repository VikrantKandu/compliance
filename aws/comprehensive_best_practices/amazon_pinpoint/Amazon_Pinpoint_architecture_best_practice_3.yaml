    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors to gain access to confidential information, leading to data leaks and
      compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
      4. Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled, either through bucket policies
      or ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and only accessible by the resource
      owner.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy to restrict access. 2. Remove any public ACLs that grant access to unauthorized
      users. 3. Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings
      for the entire account or specific buckets.
