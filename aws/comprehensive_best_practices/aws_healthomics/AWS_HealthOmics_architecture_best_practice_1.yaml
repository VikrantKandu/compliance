    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect
      AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, a compromised password is sufficient for an attacker to
      gain full control of an AWS account. Enabling MFA significantly reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage" and follow the prompts
      to assign an MFA device.
