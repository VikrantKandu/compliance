    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      root account to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification, which helps protect against unauthorized
      access to the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is critical because it significantly
      reduces the risk of account compromise. The root account has unrestricted access
      to all resources, and if compromised, it could lead to severe security breaches,
      including data loss, unauthorized access, and service disruptions.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users" and then "Security credentials." 4.
      Check the "MFA" column for the root account to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM service. 3. In the "Security credentials" section, select "Activate
      MFA on your root account." 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure
      and activate MFA using a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
