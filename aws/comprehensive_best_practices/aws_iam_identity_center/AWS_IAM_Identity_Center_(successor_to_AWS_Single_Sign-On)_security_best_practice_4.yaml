    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Public accessibility can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
      Restricting access reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that the "Block all
      public access" settings are enabled. 5. Review bucket policies and ensure they
      do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all
      public access" settings. 5. Review and modify bucket policies to ensure no public
      access is granted unless necessary.
