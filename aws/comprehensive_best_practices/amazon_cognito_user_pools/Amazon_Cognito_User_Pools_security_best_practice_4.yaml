    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication. This helps protect
      user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials and unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to attacks, especially
      if passwords are weak or compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user, choose 'Security credentials' and then 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
