  - Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: CloudFormation stacks should be configured to use encryption for
      sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized access. This includes ensuring
      that any resources created by the stack that support encryption are configured
      to use it.
  - Rationale: Encryption is a fundamental security measure that helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption, data
      is vulnerable to interception and misuse, which can lead to data leaks and compliance
      violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Select a stack and review the resources it creates. 4. For each
      resource, check if encryption is enabled where applicable (e.g., S3 buckets,
      RDS instances). 5. Verify that the encryption keys used are managed appropriately.
  - Default Value: By default, some AWS resources may not have encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Update the CloudFormation template to include encryption configuration
      for all applicable resources. 2. Redeploy the stack with the updated template.
      3. Ensure that encryption keys are managed securely and access is restricted
      to authorized users only.
