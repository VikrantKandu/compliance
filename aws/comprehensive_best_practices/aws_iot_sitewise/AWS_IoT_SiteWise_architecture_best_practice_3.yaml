    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the account and its resources, potentially
      leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit: To verify compliance, list all IAM users and check the status of their
      MFA devices. Use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-users' to retrieve a list
      of users, and 'aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>' for each user
      to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: If a user does not have MFA enabled, configure an MFA device for
      the user. This can be done via the AWS Management Console by navigating to the
      IAM service, selecting the user, and then adding an MFA device. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam enable-mfa-device' to set up MFA programmatically.
