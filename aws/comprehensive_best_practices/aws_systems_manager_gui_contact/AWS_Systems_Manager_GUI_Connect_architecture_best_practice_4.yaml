    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as unauthorized
      users can access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring buckets are private helps
      protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that no bucket ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
