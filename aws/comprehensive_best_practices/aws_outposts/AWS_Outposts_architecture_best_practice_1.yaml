    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring an additional form of verification.
    Rationale: MFA adds an extra layer of security to the root account, protecting
      against unauthorized access even if the password is compromised. Without MFA,
      the root account is more vulnerable to attacks, which could lead to unauthorized
      access to critical resources and data.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Locate the root account and check
      the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS
      CLI command 'aws iam get-account-summary' and check the 'AccountMFAEnabled'
      field.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and sign in as the root user.
      2. Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)', select 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the instructions to set up a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device. 5. Confirm the MFA setup to ensure it is
      functioning correctly.
