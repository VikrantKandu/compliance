    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to be private to prevent
      unauthorized access. This involves setting bucket policies and access control
      lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access to only necessary users
      and services mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the ACL settings do not grant public read or write permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Adjust the ACL settings to ensure no public permissions are granted.
    - Consider enabling "Block Public Access" settings for additional security.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
