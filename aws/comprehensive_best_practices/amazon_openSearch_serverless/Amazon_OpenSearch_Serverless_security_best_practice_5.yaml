    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to sensitive data
      being exposed to the internet, which can result in data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that public access
      settings block all public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to programmatically verify that
      the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Under Block public access, click Edit and enable all options to block public
      access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access is allowed.
