    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to data breaches by exposing sensitive information.
      Restricting access helps in protecting data from unauthorized access and potential
      misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check for any public access settings in the bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure only authorized users have access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent public access to the bucket.
