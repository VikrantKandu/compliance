  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to maintaining data
      privacy and security. Publicly exposed buckets can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, leading to unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions under the 'Permissions' tab.
      4. Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
      5. Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow
      public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable 'Block all public access' for the bucket in the S3 console.
      2. Review and update bucket policies to ensure they do not grant public access.
      3. Adjust ACLs to remove any public permissions. 4. Consider using AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) policies to enforce access controls.
