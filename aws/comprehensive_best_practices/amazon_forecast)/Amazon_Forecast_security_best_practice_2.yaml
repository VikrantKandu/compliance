    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS accounts. Enabling MFA for all IAM users ensures that even
      if a user's password is compromised, unauthorized access is still prevented.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      which can lead to data breaches, unauthorized resource usage, and potential
      financial loss. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to attacks if passwords
      are leaked or guessed.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Verify that 'Assigned MFA device' is listed under the 'Multi-factor authentication'
      section.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication' section, click 'Manage' and follow the
      steps to assign an MFA device.
