    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3. Publicly
      accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant
      security risk.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public access to
      S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies to ensure no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically check bucket permissions and policies.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a policy allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to restrict access only to authorized users.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to
      control access to the bucket.
