    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data theft, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
      Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click 'Edit' under 'Block public access'.
    - Ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled and save changes.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
