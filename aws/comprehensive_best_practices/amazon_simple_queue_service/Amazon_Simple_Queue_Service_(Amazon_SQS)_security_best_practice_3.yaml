    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption ensures that
      data is automatically encrypted before it is stored and decrypted when accessed
      by authorized users.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets protects sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3
      is vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if access controls are misconfigured
      or compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to ensure that 'Default Encryption' is
      set to 'Enabled'.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption to verify
      encryption settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have encryption enabled.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab, and under 'Default Encryption', enable server-side
      encryption by selecting an encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to new objects stored in the bucket.
