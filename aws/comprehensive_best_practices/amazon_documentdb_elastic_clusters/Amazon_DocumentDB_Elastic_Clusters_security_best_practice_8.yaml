    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Verify that no bucket has a policy allowing public access.
    - Check for any buckets with public ACLs and ensure they are set to private.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the bucket's ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
