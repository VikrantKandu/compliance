    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    - Verify that no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
