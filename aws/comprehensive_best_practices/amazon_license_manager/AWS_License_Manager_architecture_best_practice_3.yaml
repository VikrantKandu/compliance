    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block public access" settings for each bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Regularly review and update bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
