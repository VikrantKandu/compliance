    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      information. Restricting bucket access to only necessary users and services
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Permissions' tab for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings and ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable 'Block all public access' in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access at a
      more granular level.
