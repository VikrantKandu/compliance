    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps in maintaining data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access. 5. Ensure that "Block all public access" settings
      are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console. 2. Go
      to the "Permissions" tab. 3. Enable the "Block all public access" option. 4.
      Review and update the bucket policy to ensure it does not grant public access.
