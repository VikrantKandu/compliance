    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency and security across the
      environment.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps ensure that instances are configured according
      to organizational security and operational standards. Unapproved AMIs may contain
      vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - List all running instances and verify the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Check if the AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs defined by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on which AMIs can be used for
      launching EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Stop the non-compliant instances.
    - Launch new instances using approved AMIs.
    - Migrate data and configurations from the non-compliant instances to the new
      instances.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instances after successful migration.
