    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with security standards.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Step 5: Review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Action 2: Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Action 3: Regularly monitor S3 bucket settings and configurations to ensure
        compliance.
