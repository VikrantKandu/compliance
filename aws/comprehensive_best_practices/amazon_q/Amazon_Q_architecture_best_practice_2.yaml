    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA provides an extra layer of security
      by requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the
      user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have
      immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS account. Without MFA, an attacker who has obtained or guessed
      a user's password could gain access to your AWS resources. MFA mitigates this
      risk by adding an additional layer of security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user name to open the user's details page.
    - On the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
