  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and potential
      data breaches.
  - Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public buckets can expose data to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and bucket policy.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access permissions enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block public access settings and enable all options to block public
      access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Save changes to apply the updated settings.
