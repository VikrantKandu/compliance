    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide two forms of authentication, enhancing
      the protection of AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, the
      attacker can easily gain access to the AWS account. MFA mitigates this risk
      by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM Dashboard, select 'Users'.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled. This can be seen under the 'Security
      credentials' tab for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        verify MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the 'Users' section and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the steps to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
