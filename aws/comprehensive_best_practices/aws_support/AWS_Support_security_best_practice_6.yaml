    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. By ensuring buckets are private, you mitigate the risk of data leaks
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify bucket permissions.
    - Set bucket policies and ACLs to deny public access.
    - Enable the Block Public Access feature for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
