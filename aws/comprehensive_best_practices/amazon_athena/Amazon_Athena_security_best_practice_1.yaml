    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps maintain data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets allow public access unless explicitly blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
