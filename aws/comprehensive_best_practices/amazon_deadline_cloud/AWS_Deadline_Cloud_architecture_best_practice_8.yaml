    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to unauthorized access and data loss. Restricting public access helps
      maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is
      enabled. 4. Check the bucket policy and ACL to confirm no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs remediation. 4. Click on 'Permissions' and enable
      'Block all public access'. 5. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to
      remove any public access permissions.
