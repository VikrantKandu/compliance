    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users in your
      AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password
      and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece
      of information only they should know or have immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access,
      data breaches, and potential financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Review the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab, and then choose 'Manage MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
