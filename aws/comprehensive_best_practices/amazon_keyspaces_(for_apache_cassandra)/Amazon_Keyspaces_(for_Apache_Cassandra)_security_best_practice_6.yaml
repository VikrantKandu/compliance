    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption can help protect sensitive
      information stored in S3 from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets helps safeguard data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data
      stored in S3 is vulnerable to various security threats, including data theft
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to inspect.
    - Under the Properties tab, check if the "Default encryption" section is enabled.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is set to either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that requires encryption.
    - Go to the Properties tab of the bucket.
    - Enable default encryption and choose either AES-256 or AWS-KMS as the encryption
      type.
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption.
