    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker could gain full access to the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring
      a second factor that is not easily compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Review the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and check the 'MFADevices'
      list for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
