    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled to enhance account security by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      not only a password but also a secondary factor, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access in case of compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user without MFA enabled.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage MFA device.'
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
