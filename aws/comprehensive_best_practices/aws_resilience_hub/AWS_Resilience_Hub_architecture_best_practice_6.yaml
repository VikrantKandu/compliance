    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
      By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can protect sensitive
      information and comply with data privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable public access settings by blocking all public access.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant
      public access.
