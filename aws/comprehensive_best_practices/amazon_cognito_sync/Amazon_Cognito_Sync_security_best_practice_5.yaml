    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be restricted to prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality, reducing the risk of data leaks and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and identify those with public access.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy to ensure they
      do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block Public Access settings.
    - Ensure that block public access settings are enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
