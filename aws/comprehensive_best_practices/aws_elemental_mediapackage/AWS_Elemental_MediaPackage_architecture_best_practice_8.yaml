    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure, potential data loss, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to block public
      access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
