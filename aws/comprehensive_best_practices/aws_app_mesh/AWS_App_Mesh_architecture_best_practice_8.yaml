    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data stored
      in the cloud is protected from unauthorized access and breaches. Without encryption,
      sensitive data may be exposed in the event of a security incident.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check encryption settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the bucket properties and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS) and save the changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-encryption to apply
      encryption settings programmatically.
