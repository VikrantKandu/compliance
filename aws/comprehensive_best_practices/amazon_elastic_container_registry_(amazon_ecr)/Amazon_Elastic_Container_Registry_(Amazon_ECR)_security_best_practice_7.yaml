  - ID: AWS-S3-01
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict access
      only to authorized users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not public helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure public access is blocked. 5. Review bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access, but configurations
      can be changed by users.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to
      restrict access to authorized users only.
