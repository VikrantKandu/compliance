  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from being accessed by unauthorized users. Public exposure of S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches, data loss, and compliance violations.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of S3 buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow
        public access.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket policies and ACLs and verify they
        do not include public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation:
    - Action 1: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK to modify bucket policies
        and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Action 2: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access to
        buckets and objects.
    - Action 3: Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
