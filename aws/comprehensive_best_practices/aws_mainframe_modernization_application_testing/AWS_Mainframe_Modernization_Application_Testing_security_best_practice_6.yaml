    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Public access can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Check the bucket policy for any statements that allow public access.
    - Verify the bucket's Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
