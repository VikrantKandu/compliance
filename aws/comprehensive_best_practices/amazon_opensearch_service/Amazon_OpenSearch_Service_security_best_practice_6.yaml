    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets in your AWS account are not
      publicly accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and
      security breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      potentially exposing sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      against unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy or ACL that allows public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to maintain compliance.
