    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. It is essential to maintain data
      privacy and comply with regulatory requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
