    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, which
      may lead to data leaks, compliance violations, and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that public access
      is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that no public access permissions are set.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Navigate to the Permissions tab.
    - Under 'Block public access', ensure all options are enabled to block public
      access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
