  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      leading to privacy violations and compliance issues. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates the risk of data leaks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab. 4. Verify that the bucket policy
      and ACL do not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws
      s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is publicly accessible, remove any public access granted
      through the bucket policy and ACL. 2. Use the AWS Management Console or CLI
      to adjust permissions. 3. Implement S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent
      future unauthorized public access.
