    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that S3 bucket permissions are
      configured to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not public reduces the risk of sensitive
      information being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
