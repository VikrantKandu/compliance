    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      level.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
