    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure compliance with security and operational standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps maintain consistency, security, and compliance
      across all EC2 instances. Unapproved AMIs may lack necessary updates or configurations,
      posing security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running instances.
    - Verify the AMI ID for each instance against the list of approved AMIs.
    - Ensure that each instance is using an AMI that is on the approved list.
    Default Value: Instances can be launched using any publicly available or custom
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan a migration to approved AMIs, ensuring minimal disruption.
    - Launch new instances using approved AMIs and migrate workloads.
    - Terminate instances using unapproved AMIs once migration is complete.
