    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps safeguard sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with data protection standards.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets is vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling encryption helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality, reducing the risk of data exposure.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab. 4. Check if the "Default encryption"
      option is enabled under the "Default encryption" section. 5. Repeat for all
      buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to configure. 4. Go to the Properties tab. 5.
      Under the "Default encryption" section, select "Enable" and choose the desired
      encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS). 6. Save changes and repeat for
      all applicable buckets.
