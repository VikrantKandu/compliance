    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      full access to the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring an additional
      verification step.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is activated under the 'Security credentials' tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Users' and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to activate MFA.
