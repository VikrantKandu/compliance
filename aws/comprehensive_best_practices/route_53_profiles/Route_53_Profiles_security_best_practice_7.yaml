    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access, modify, or delete data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allowing
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      modified.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Regularly monitor bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
