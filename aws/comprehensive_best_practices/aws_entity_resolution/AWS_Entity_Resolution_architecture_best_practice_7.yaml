    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets pose a significant security risk, as they can expose
      sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Ensure that each bucket's permissions do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to only authorized users or roles.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
