    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in potential data breaches, loss of customer trust, and non-compliance
      with data protection regulations. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions and ensure there are no public access policies.
    - Verify that the bucket settings block public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions.
    - Apply a bucket policy that denies public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" feature in the S3 bucket settings.
