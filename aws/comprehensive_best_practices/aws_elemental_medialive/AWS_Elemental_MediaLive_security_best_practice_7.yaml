    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and pose security risks.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block public access" settings are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to verify no public access
      is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and edit the "Block public access" settings to enable
      blocking of all public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
