    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Using approved AMIs helps maintain security and
      compliance standards within the organization.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities and non-compliant
      configurations into your environment. Approved AMIs are vetted for security,
      compliance, and performance, reducing the risk of introducing potential threats.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID used.
    - "Verify that the AMI ID is listed in the organization\u2019s approved AMI list."
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any publicly available
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Create a snapshot of the current instance state.
    - Launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate data and configurations from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the instance running on an unapproved AMI.
