    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, you mitigate the risk of
      unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by
      attackers to access sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and block public access settings for each bucket.
    - Verify that no buckets have public access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
