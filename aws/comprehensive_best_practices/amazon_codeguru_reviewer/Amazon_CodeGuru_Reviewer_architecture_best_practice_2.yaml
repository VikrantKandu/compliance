    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, the
      risk of account compromise is significantly higher.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" and follow the instructions to assign
      an MFA device.
