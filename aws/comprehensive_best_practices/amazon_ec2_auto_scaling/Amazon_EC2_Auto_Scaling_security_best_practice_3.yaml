  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Public access can lead to
      inadvertent exposure of confidential information.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all
      public access' settings are enabled. 4. Verify that no bucket policies or access
      control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 service.
      2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on 'Permissions'
      and then 'Block public access'. 4. Enable 'Block all public access' and save
      the changes. 5. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to ensure they
      do not allow public access.
