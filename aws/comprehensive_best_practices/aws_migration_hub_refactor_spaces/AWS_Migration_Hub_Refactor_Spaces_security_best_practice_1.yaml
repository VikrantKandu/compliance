    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of
      security for accessing AWS resources. Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts
      from unauthorized access by requiring a second form of verification, such as
      a one-time password, in addition to the standard username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised accounts,
      as it requires an additional authentication factor that is not easily obtained
      by malicious actors. Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to phishing
      attacks, password guessing, and other forms of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the list of IAM users and verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically list users
      and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the IAM user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)", choose "Assign MFA device".
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device
      to the user.
