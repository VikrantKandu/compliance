    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive information, leading
      to compliance violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for public indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to view the permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and locate the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Remove any public access settings by updating the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
