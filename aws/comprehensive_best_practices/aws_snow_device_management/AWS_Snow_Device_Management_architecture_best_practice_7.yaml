    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring users to provide two forms of authentication.
      This helps protect your account from unauthorized access, even if a password
      is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised,
      the account can be easily accessed by an attacker.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the column for MFA device to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication (MFA) section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
