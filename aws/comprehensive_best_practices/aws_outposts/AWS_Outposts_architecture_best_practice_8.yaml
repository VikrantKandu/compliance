    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI to list bucket permissions: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
    - Confirm that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable any public access settings.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS CLI to update bucket policy: aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        --policy file://policy.json
