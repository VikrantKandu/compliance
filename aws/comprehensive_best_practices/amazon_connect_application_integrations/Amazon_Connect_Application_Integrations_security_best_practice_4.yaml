    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access by requiring
      a second form of verification. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Check each user to ensure MFA
      is enabled by verifying that the "MFA" column displays "Enabled".
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 4. Choose the
      "Security credentials" tab. 5. In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section,
      choose "Assign MFA device". 6. Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA
      for the user.
