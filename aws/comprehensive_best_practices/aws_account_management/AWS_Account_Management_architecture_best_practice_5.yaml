    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select each user and check if MFA is enabled in the Security credentials tab.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the Security credentials tab, choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
