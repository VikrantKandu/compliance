    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive data and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to unauthorized access and data leaks. By ensuring buckets are private,
      you mitigate the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
