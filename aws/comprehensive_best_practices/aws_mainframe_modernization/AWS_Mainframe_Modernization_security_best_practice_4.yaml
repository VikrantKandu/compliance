    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a user name and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps secure
      their AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker can
      gain full access to the user's AWS account. Enabling MFA significantly reduces
      this risk by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, click on "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Click on "Users" in the navigation pane. 4. Select a user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In
      the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Assign MFA device".
      7. Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
