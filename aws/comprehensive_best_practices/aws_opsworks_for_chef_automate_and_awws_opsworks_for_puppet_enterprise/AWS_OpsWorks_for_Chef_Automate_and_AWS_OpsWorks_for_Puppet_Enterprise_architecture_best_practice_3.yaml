    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not have public
      access enabled. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and their permissions. 4. Check the bucket policy
      and ACL settings for each bucket to ensure they do not allow public access.
      5. Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review and modify the bucket policy and ACL settings to
      remove any public access permissions. 4. Enable Block Public Access settings
      for each bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
