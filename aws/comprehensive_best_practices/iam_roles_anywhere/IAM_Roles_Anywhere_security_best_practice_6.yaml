    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose
      sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches, which can have severe financial and reputational
      impacts on the organization. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and identify buckets with public access enabled. 4.
      For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      no public access permissions are granted. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and
      ACL. 2. Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access
      settings. 3. Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
