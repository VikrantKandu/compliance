    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      in the event that a user's password is compromised. Without MFA, an attacker
      with access to a user's password could gain full access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage' in the 'Assigned MFA
      device' section.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
