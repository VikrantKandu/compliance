  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data
      breaches.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be exploited by malicious
      actors to access sensitive data. Restricting public access helps protect the
      confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the buckets.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings. 4. Verify that
      the "Block all public access" option is enabled. 5. Review bucket policies and
      access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public permissions are granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Enable "Block all public access"
      in the bucket's settings. 4. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove
      any public permissions. 5. Save the changes to apply the updated settings.
