    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to log all account
      activity, providing a history of AWS API calls for your account.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions helps in tracking changes to AWS
      resources, which is crucial for security analysis, resource change tracking,
      and compliance auditing. Without it, unauthorized changes and activities may
      go undetected.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      console. 3. Verify that a trail is created and configured to log events in all
      regions. 4. Confirm that the trail is set to log both management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation: 1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail
      service. 2. Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to enable logging
      in all regions. 3. Ensure the trail is configured to log both management and
      data events. 4. Save the changes to apply the configuration.
