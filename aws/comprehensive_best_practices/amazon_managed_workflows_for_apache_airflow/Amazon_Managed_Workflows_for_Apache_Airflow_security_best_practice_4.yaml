    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible reduces the risk of data exposure and complies with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to review bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy: aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket
        <bucket_name> --policy <policy_json>.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket ACL: aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket
        <bucket_name> --acl private.
