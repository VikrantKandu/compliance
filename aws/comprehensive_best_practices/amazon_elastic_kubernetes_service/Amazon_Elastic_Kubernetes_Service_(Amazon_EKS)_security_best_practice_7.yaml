    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a physical device.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect your AWS environment by adding an additional
      layer of security. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker
      can easily access your AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Check each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled and verify all users are listed.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select a user and choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Manage.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
