    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access. By default, S3 buckets are private, but changes
      in settings can lead to exposure of sensitive data.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private protects sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data leaks, legal issues, and financial losses.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to verify that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to programmatically check the
      bucket ACL settings.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket your-bucket-name --acl
      private to set the bucket ACL to private.
