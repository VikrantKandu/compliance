    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance account security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of your username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts by requiring an additional
      verification method, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to compromise through phishing attacks or password
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-mfa-devices to list MFA
        devices for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
