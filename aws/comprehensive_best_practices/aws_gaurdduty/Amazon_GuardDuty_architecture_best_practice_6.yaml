    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to add an extra layer
      of security. MFA requires users to provide additional authentication factors
      beyond just a password, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's password can easily
      compromise the account. MFA mitigates this risk by requiring a second form of
      verification.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM users.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for each user by verifying the MFA column or by going
      into each user's security credentials.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the user.
