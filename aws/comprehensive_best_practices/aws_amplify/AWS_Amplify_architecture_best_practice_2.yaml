    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using AMIs
      that have been approved by the organization. Approved AMIs are typically pre-configured
      with security patches and organizational standards.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can lead to security vulnerabilities as they
      may not be patched or configured according to organizational standards. This
      increases the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running instances and note their AMI IDs.
    - Compare these AMI IDs against the list of approved AMIs maintained by the organization.
    - Verify that all instances are using approved AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate data and applications to the new instance.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instance.
