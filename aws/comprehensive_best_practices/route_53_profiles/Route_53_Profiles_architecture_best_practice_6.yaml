    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, unauthorized
      access, and data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>
        and ensure no public grants are present.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
