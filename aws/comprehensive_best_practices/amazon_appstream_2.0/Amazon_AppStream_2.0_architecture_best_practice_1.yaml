    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all newly created S3 buckets are private
      by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets set to public can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Verify that each bucket's access control list (ACL) and bucket policy do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are set to private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - For any bucket that is public, modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      access.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
