    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to verify that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the
      bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the permissions tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any
      public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
