    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      typically a code from a mobile device, in addition to their password. This helps
      protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the AWS account, potentially leading to
      data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
