    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks as it allows unrestricted access. Assigning custom security groups with
      specific rules enhances security by limiting access to only necessary ports
      and IP ranges.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create custom security groups with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Reassign the instances to the newly created security groups.
    - Ensure the default security group is not used for any instances.
