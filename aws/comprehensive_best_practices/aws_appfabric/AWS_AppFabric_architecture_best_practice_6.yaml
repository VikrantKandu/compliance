    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that versioning is enabled on all S3 buckets to
      protect against accidental deletion or overwriting of objects. Versioning allows
      you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored
      in your buckets.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets provides protection against data
      loss due to accidental deletions or overwrites. It allows for the recovery of
      previous versions of objects, reducing the risk of data loss and enhancing data
      durability.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the Properties tab to see if Versioning
      is enabled. 5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all buckets in the account.
    Default Value: By default, versioning is not enabled on S3 buckets.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket for which you want to enable versioning. 4. Go to the Properties
      tab. 5. Under the Versioning section, click "Edit" and enable versioning. 6.
      Save changes.
