    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access. Public buckets can be exploited by attackers to access
      or alter data, leading to data loss or leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
