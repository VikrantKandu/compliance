    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive information
      is exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      access and data leaks. Public exposure of sensitive data can lead to compliance
      violations and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket ACL for public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to inspect
      the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" and then "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
