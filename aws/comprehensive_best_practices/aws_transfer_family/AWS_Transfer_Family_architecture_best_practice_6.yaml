    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Restricting access helps protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to review bucket ACLs and ensure
      no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets have 'Block all public access'
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
