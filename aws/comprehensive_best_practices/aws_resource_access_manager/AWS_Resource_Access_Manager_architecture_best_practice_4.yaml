    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. The root account has unrestricted
      access to all resources and settings in the AWS account, making it a critical
      security target.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access, even if the root account password is compromised. Without
      MFA, attackers could gain full control over the AWS environment, leading to
      potential data breaches, resource misuse, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the AccountMFAEnabled field.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device using an MFA application.
    - Complete the MFA setup by confirming the generated codes.
