    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. This best practice involves configuring bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks by restricting access to only authorized users and services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and ACL to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that IsPublic is set to false.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to configure the bucket to block all public
      access.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with the best
      practice.
