    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for AWS accounts by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
      This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      full access to the account. MFA adds an additional layer of security, making
      it significantly harder for attackers to access AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify if MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
