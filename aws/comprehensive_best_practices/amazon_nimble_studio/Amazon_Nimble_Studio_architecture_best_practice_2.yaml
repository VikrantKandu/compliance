    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that bucket policies do not allow public
      access is crucial for data security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting access to only necessary users and services helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings and ensure they are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm there are
      no public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and enable Block Public Access settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
