    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private prevents
      unauthorized access and protects data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure no buckets have public access.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL settings for each bucket to confirm they do
      not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS Config to list bucket permissions and verify compliance programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket's ACL.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature in the S3 console to prevent future public
      access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
