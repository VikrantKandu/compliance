    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in All Regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: AWS CloudTrail should be enabled in all regions to record all API
      calls made in your AWS account. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls
      for your account, including API calls made via the AWS Management Console, AWS
      SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions helps ensure that all API activities
      are logged and can be monitored for security and compliance purposes. Without
      CloudTrail, it may be difficult to track changes and access patterns, increasing
      the risk of undetected malicious activities or unintended changes.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that a trail is configured to log events in all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is set to deliver log files to an S3 bucket.
    - Check that the trail is configured to log both management and data events.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to enable logging in all regions.
    - Configure the trail to deliver logs to an S3 bucket and enable logging for both
      management and data events.
    - Save the changes to ensure compliance with the best practice.
