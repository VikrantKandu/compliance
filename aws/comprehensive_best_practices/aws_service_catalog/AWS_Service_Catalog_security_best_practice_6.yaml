    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data access and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the public internet, leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      and verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
