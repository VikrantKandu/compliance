    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. Enabling MFA adds an
      extra layer of protection on top of a username and password, requiring users
      to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts,
      as it requires an additional verification step beyond just a password. Without
      MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to compromise, potentially leading to unauthorized
      data access, service disruptions, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by confirming the presence of an MFA
      device.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user that needs MFA enabled.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
