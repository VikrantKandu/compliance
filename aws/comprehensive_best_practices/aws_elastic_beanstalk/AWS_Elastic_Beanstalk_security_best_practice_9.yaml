    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Public access can be
      granted through bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Unauthorized access can lead
      to data breaches, loss of confidentiality, and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow
      public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify ACLs and aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
