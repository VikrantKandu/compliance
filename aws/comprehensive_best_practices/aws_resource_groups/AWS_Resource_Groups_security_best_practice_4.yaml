  - Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
      4. Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review the ACL
      settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and do not allow
      public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Remove any public access
      permissions from the bucket policy and ACL. 5. Enable Block Public Access settings
      for the bucket. 6. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
