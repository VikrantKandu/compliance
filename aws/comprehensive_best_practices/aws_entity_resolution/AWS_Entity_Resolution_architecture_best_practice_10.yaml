    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By restricting public access, you mitigate
      the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and select the S3 service.
    - For any bucket that is publicly accessible, navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Save the changes to restrict public access.
