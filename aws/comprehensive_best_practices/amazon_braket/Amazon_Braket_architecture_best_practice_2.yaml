    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible is crucial
      for data protection and privacy.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that "Block all public
      access" settings are enabled. 5. Ensure there are no bucket policies or access
      control lists (ACLs) that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Use the AWS Management Console to navigate to the S3 service.
      2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab and enable "Block all public access." 4. Review and remove any bucket policies
      or ACLs that allow public access.
