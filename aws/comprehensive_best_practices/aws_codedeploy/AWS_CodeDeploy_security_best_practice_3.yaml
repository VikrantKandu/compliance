    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet, potentially leading to data
      leaks and unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
