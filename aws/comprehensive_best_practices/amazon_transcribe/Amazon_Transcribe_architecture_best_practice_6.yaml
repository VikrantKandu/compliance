    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to the internet, which
      can lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      potentially leading to unauthorized data access and data breaches. Ensuring
      buckets are private mitigates this risk.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and their permissions. 4. For each bucket, check
      the "Public Access" settings under "Permissions". 5. Ensure that "Block all
      public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab. 5. Enable "Block all public access" to prevent public access to the bucket.
