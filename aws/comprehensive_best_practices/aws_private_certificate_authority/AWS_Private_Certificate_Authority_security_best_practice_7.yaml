    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets can be publicly accessible, which may lead to
      data breaches if sensitive information is stored without proper access controls.
      Ensuring buckets are private by default reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for any public access permissions.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are publicly accessible unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Set the bucket policy to deny public access by default.
    - Review and modify the ACL to ensure only authorized users have access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings
      for all buckets in the account.
