  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can lead to exposure of sensitive data
      to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are private minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that the "Block all
      public access" setting is enabled. 5. Confirm there are no bucket policies or
      access control lists (ACLs) granting public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket with public access. 4. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 5.
      Enable "Block all public access." 6. Review and modify any bucket policies or
      ACLs to remove public access permissions.
