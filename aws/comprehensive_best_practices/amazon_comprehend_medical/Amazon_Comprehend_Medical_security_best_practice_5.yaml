    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. By ensuring buckets
      are not public, organizations can protect their data from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
