  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and
      confidentiality.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Check the 'Block
      public access' settings to ensure public access is blocked. 5. Verify bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. For any bucket with public access, go to the 'Permissions' tab.
      2. Enable 'Block all public access' settings. 3. Review and modify bucket policies
      and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
