    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure consistency and security compliance across the
      environment.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that all instances adhere to organizational
      security policies, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and configuration drift.
      Unapproved AMIs may contain outdated software, unpatched vulnerabilities, or
      misconfigurations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running instances.
    - Check the AMI ID for each instance and verify if it matches the list of approved
      AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      or custom AMIs.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using unapproved AMIs.
    - Create a snapshot of the instance for backup.
    - Terminate the instance and launch a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Restore data from the snapshot if necessary.
