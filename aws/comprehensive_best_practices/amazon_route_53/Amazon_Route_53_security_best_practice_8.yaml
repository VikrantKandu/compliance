    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be set to private to prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive data. This ensures that only authorized users can access the contents
      of the bucket.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Check for any public access settings that might override the bucket-level settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but settings can be changed
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket to ensure it cannot
      be made public accidentally.
