    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound
      traffic, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to and from the instance, increasing the potential for unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'Security groups' column to ensure that it is not
      using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may associate with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per
      your security requirements.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the instance.
    - Associate the newly created security group with the instance.
