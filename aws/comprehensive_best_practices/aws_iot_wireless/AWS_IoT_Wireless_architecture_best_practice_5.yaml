    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps protect data by
      encrypting it using encryption keys managed by AWS or a customer.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption,
      data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data
      leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Properties tab.
    - Check if "Default encryption" is enabled and configured with an encryption key.
    - Repeat for each bucket in the account.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket to enable encryption.
    - Go to the Properties tab and enable "Default encryption."
    - Choose an encryption method, such as AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) or
      Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3).
    - Save the changes.
