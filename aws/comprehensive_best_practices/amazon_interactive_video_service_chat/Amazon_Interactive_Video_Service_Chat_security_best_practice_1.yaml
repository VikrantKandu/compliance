    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure or data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data privacy and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable bucket policy and ACLs to block public access if necessary.
    - Use AWS Config or S3 Block Public Access settings to enforce compliance.
