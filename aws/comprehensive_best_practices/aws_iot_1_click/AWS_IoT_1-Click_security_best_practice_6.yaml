    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information and
      complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Config to list and check bucket policies for public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings in the S3 console to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and apply the principle of least privilege.
