    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects sensitive data from
      being exposed to the internet, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      data access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl' to verify bucket ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy' to review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
