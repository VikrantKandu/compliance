    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. This includes checking bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs).
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data leaks and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces
      the risk of data breaches and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with a public access indicator.
    - Check bucket policies and ACLs for any settings that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Remove any ACLs that grant public read or write permissions.
    - Utilize AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to enforce restrictions on public
      access.
