    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not public helps
      maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket is not
      publicly accessible.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access settings in the bucket policies or ACLs.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
