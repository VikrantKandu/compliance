    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. S3 buckets should be
      configured to allow access only to authorized users and applications.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure and protects against potential security threats.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public access. 5. Use AWS
      CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically check the bucket policies and ACLs for public
      access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and
      ACL. 2. Enable Block Public Access settings on the bucket to prevent future
      public access. 3. Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance
      with security best practices.
