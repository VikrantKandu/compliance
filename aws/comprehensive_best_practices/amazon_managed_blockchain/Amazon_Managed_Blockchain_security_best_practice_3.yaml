    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and
      lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leakage, unauthorized
      access, and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates these risks and protects sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, select the bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to grant access to specific users or services as needed.
