    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data and should be avoided unless necessary.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps maintain
      data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that no buckets are publicly accessible unless explicitly required.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list bucket policies and ACLs to
      ensure compliance.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to update the bucket policies and ACLs programmatically.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
