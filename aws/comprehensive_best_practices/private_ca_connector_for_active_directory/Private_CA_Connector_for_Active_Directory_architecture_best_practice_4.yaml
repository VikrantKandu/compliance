  - Title: Ensure IAM Users Do Not Have Console Access
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: IAM users should not have console access to minimize the risk of
      unauthorized access to the AWS Management Console. This is crucial for maintaining
      a secure cloud environment by restricting access to only those who need it.
  - Rationale: Limiting console access reduces the attack surface and potential unauthorized
      actions within the AWS environment. If IAM users have unnecessary console access,
      it could lead to security breaches, data leaks, or unauthorized modifications.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if "Console Access" is enabled under the "Permissions"
      tab.
    - Verify that only users who require console access have it enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users can be created with console access if specified.
  - Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For users with unnecessary console access, select the user, go to the "Security
      credentials" tab, and disable console access.
    - Alternatively, remove the user from any group or policy that provides console
      access.
