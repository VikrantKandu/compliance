    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to
      data breaches. Restricting access to only authorized users mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket policy does
        not allow public access.
    - Step 4: Check the bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Step 5: Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify bucket ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Step 5: Adjust the bucket ACLs to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Step 6: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
