  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data security and privacy.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that no public access
      is granted. 4. Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do
      not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      and aws s3api get-bucket-policy to programmatically check bucket permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is not granted
      unless explicitly configured.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access granted through bucket policies or ACLs.
      2. Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket. 3. Regularly review
      and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
