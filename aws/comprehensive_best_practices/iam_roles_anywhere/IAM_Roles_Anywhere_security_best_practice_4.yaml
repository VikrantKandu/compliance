    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      maintain data security and privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with a public access indicator.
    - Check bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Modify bucket permissions and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
