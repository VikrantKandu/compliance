  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of accidental data exposure and complies with security best
      practices.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL).
      4. Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Use the AWS
      CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check ACLs. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket-name> to review bucket policies.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACLs. 2.
      Update the bucket policy to restrict public access. 3. Implement block public
      access settings at the bucket and account level to prevent future public access
      configurations.
