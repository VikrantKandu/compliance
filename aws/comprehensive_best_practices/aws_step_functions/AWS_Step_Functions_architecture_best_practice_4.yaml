    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS accounts by requiring not only a password and username but also
      something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only
      they should know or have immediately to hand.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect your AWS resources from
      unauthorized access. If a password is compromised, MFA provides a second layer
      of defense, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check if MFA is enabled.
      5. Verify that all users have MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security credentials tab. 6. In the Multi-factor
      authentication section, choose Assign MFA device. 7. Follow the on-screen instructions
      to configure and activate MFA for the user.
