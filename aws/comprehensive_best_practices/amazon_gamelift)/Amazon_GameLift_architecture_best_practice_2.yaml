  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can expose your instances to unintended
      network access. It is recommended to create custom security groups with specific
      inbound and outbound rules tailored to the application's needs to enhance security.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security group. 5. Verify that none of the instances are using the
      default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Security Groups' from the left-hand menu. 4. Create a new security
      group with specific inbound and outbound rules. 5. Associate the new security
      group with the EC2 instances currently using the default security group.
