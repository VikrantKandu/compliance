    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      leaks, compliance violations, and unauthorized data manipulation.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) for any public access
      settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update the ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Consider enabling AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public
      access configurations.
