  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, preventing
      unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are private
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public Access Settings" to ensure "Block all public
      access" is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings of each bucket for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can modify the settings.
  - Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket's permissions
      to block public access.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket's settings.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to restrict access to authorized
      users only.
