    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure, which can result in loss of sensitive information, compliance
      violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that there are no public access settings enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Disable public access by adjusting the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
