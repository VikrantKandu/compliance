    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in the AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of security by
      requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, in addition to their
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who obtains a user's password
      could gain access to your AWS account and potentially compromise sensitive data
      or services.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on each user to open their details page.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
