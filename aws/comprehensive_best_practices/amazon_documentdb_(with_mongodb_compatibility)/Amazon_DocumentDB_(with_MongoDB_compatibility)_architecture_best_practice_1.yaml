    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      ensure sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Public access to
      S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure and helps maintain data privacy and compliance
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that no buckets are set to allow public access by checking the "Block
      all public access" setting.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that may
      allow public access.
