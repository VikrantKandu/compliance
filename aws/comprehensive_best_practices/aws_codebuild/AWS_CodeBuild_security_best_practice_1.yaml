    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This check ensures that the bucket policies and ACLs
      are configured to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. Restricting public access mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to confirm the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
