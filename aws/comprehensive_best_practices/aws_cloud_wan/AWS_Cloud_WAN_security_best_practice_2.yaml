    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      data access, data leaks, and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Ensure there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control
      access to the bucket.
