    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is crucial to protect data
      stored in S3 by ensuring that buckets are not exposed to the public internet.
    Rationale: Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Restricting bucket access to only
      authorized users helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions settings.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions set for any bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check permissions programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access," ensure all options are checked.
    - Save changes to enforce the block on public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to remove
      any public access permissions.
