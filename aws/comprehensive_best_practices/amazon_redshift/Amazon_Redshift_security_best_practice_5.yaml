    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect data
      from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for any buckets marked
      as "Public".
    - For each bucket, click on its name, go to the "Permissions" tab, and verify
      that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on "Edit" under "Block public access".
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
