    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can be controlled through
      bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), and the S3 Block Public Access
      feature.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches or exposure
      of sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure that they
      do not allow public access.
    - Check the S3 Block Public Access settings and ensure that block public access
      is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - For each bucket that allows public access, update the bucket policy and ACL
      to restrict public access.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for the bucket to prevent public access
      settings.
