    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance the security of AWS accounts. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      typically a code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts
      by requiring a second factor of authentication. If MFA is not enabled, compromised
      credentials can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security
      incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list MFA devices and verify their association with IAM users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, select "Manage" under "Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)".
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
