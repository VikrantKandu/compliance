    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read or write permissions.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive data and comply with data privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Verify that the bucket does not allow public access by checking the 'Block Public
      Access' settings.
    - Ensure that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that grant public read or write
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'.
    - Ensure all options under 'Block public access' are enabled.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
