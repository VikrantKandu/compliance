    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets in your AWS account are not
      publicly accessible. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are not public helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Verify that there are no public access permissions set for the bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to check the ACL of the bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy to check the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and update the bucket permissions and bucket policy to remove public
      access.
    - Implement S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
