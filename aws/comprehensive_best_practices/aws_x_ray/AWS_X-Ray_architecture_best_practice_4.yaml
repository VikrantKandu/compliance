  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring a second form of authentication. This check
      ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's
      credentials are exposed, an attacker could gain full access to the account.
  - Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Step 4: For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Step 5: Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
        to list users without MFA enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Users' in the left navigation pane.
    - Step 4: Click on a user to configure.
    - Step 5: Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Step 6: Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to
        assign an MFA device.
