    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of verification. This practice
      helps protect against unauthorized access to your account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, a malicious actor who obtains a user's password can
      access AWS resources without additional verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "Security Credentials" tab.
    - Verify that "Assigned MFA device" is set for each user.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select "Users".
    - Select a user and go to the "Security Credentials" tab.
    - Click "Manage" on the "Assigned MFA device" section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
