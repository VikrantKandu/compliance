    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized access to data stored in the buckets. S3 buckets should
      not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance
      violations, and potential financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and check their permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow
      public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the ACL settings for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to remove any policies or ACLs that
      allow public access.
    - Implement specific bucket policies that restrict access to only authorized users
      or applications.
