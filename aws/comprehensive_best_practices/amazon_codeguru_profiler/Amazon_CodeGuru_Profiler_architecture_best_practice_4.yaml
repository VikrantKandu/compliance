  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized data access. This involves checking bucket policies and
      access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not allow public access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket policy for statements allowing public access.
      4. Check the bucket's ACLs for any permissions granted to 'Everyone' or 'Any
      Authenticated AWS User'. 5. Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the policy status.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
      2. Modify the bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted. 3. Use the
      AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to apply these changes. 4. Enable S3 Block
      Public Access settings for the account or individual buckets.
