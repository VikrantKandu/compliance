    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection standards.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access granted via bucket policies
      or ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
