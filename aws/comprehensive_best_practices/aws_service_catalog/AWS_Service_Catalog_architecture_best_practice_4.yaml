    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to buckets can
      lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Restricting public access helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to audit.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that public access is restricted.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify no public permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access.'
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
