  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. It is crucial to restrict
      public access to S3 buckets to protect sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates these risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and check the 'Access' column for public indicators.
      4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
      5. Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled and that there are no public
      access permissions under the 'Bucket Policy' and 'Access Control List' sections.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, go to the 'Permissions' tab
      of the bucket. 2. Enable 'Block all public access'. 3. Remove any public access
      permissions from the 'Bucket Policy' and 'Access Control List'. 4. Save changes
      to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
