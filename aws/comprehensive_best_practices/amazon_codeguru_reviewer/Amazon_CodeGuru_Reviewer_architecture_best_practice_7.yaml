  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check verifies that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Approved AMIs are those that meet security and
      compliance requirements set by the organization. This helps ensure that all
      instances are configured with the necessary security controls and software updates.
  - Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce security vulnerabilities and compliance
      issues, as these images may lack necessary patches, configurations, or security
      tools. Ensuring that only approved AMIs are used reduces the risk of security
      breaches and helps maintain compliance with organizational policies.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. List all running EC2 instances. 4. For each instance, check the AMI ID and
      verify it against the list of approved AMI IDs maintained by the organization.
      5. Ensure all instances are using AMIs from the approved list.
  - Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs used when launching
      EC2 instances.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify instances running on unapproved AMIs. 2. Create a snapshot
      of the current instances for backup purposes. 3. Terminate the instances running
      on unapproved AMIs. 4. Relaunch the instances using an approved AMI. 5. Ensure
      that all future launches are restricted to approved AMIs by implementing IAM
      policies or using AWS Service Catalog.
