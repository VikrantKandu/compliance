    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation stacks are monitored and managed
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks are monitored for
      changes and managed appropriately to maintain the desired state of the infrastructure.
    Rationale: Monitoring and managing CloudFormation stacks is essential to ensure
      that infrastructure changes are tracked and that the environment remains consistent
      with the defined templates. Failure to do so can lead to configuration drift,
      security vulnerabilities, and operational inefficiencies.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudFormation
      service. 3. Review the list of stacks and check for any stacks in the 'UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED'
      or 'ROLLBACK_COMPLETE' states. 4. Verify that stack changes are being monitored
      and logged through AWS CloudTrail. 5. Ensure that notifications for stack changes
      are configured using Amazon SNS.
    Default Value: CloudFormation stacks are not monitored by default.
    Remediation: 1. Set up AWS CloudTrail to log all CloudFormation API calls. 2.
      Configure Amazon SNS to send notifications for stack changes. 3. Regularly review
      stack statuses and resolve any issues in stacks that are not in the 'CREATE_COMPLETE'
      or 'UPDATE_COMPLETE' states. 4. Implement automated monitoring tools to detect
      and alert on configuration drift.
