    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure and potential
      unauthorized data manipulation.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete sensitive data. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible mitigates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket you want to review.
    - Step 4: Check the bucket permissions under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 5: Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that needs to be remediated.
    - Step 4: Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Step 5: Remove any policies or ACL settings that grant public access.
    - Step 6: Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
