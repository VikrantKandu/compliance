    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by
      requiring users to present a second form of authentication, such as a one-time
      password from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances the security of your AWS account
      by reducing the risk of unauthorized access. If MFA is not enabled, a compromised
      password alone could allow an attacker to gain control of your account, leading
      to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the Security
      Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
      <username> for each user to confirm the presence of MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the Security Credentials tab, then Manage
      MFA. 6. Follow the steps to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device
      to the user. 7. Repeat the process for all IAM users without MFA enabled.
