  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and security vulnerabilities.
      It is crucial to restrict access to sensitive data stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive information to the public internet.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket. 4. Go to the Permissions tab. 5. Check the 'Block public
      access' settings to ensure all options are enabled. 6. Review the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL) to verify no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the non-compliant bucket. 4. Go to the Permissions tab. 5. Enable
      'Block all public access' settings. 6. Review and remove any bucket policies
      or ACLs that grant public access.
