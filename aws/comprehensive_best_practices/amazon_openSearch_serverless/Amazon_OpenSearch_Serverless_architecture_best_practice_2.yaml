    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private enhances data security and compliance with
      data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure 'Block all
      public access' is enabled. 5. Verify bucket policies and access control lists
      (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable 'Block all public access' for the S3 bucket. 2. Review
      and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly monitor bucket permissions for compliance.
