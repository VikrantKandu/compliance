  - Title: Enable Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for all EC2 instances
      to provide enhanced visibility into resource utilization and performance metrics.
      Detailed monitoring provides data at 1-minute intervals, which is crucial for
      real-time analysis and decision-making.
  - Rationale: Enabling detailed monitoring allows for more granular insights into
      the performance and operational health of EC2 instances. Without it, the default
      5-minute monitoring intervals may not capture short-lived spikes or anomalies,
      leading to potential performance issues going undetected.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. Check the Monitoring column
      for each instance to see if detailed monitoring is enabled. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and check the output for
      each instance under the Monitoring attribute.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances are launched with basic monitoring, which
      provides data at 5-minute intervals.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the instance(s) for which you want to enable detailed monitoring. 3. Click on
      the 'Actions' dropdown menu, then select 'Monitor and troubleshoot' and 'Manage
      detailed monitoring'. 4. Enable detailed monitoring and save the changes.
