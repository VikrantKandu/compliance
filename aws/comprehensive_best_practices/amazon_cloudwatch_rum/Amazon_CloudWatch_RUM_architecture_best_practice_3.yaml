    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access or modify sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access permissions enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and review the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Save the changes to update the bucket's access settings.
