    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure data is
      not exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data
      breaches and unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      and bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access logs to ensure compliance.
