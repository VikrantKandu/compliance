  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to ensure
      data is protected from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive information and
      maintains compliance with data privacy regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
