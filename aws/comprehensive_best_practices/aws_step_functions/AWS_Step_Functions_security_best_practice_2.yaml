    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and pose
      a security risk. It's crucial to restrict access to only those who require it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists
        (ACLs).
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket does not have public access permissions or policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify buckets that are publicly accessible.
    - Step 2: Modify bucket policies to remove public access permissions.
    - Step 3: Update bucket ACLs to restrict access to only authorized users.
    - Step 4: Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to buckets
        and objects.
