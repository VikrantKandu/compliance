    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data
      breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious actors to access or manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDKs to programmatically check the bucket policies
      and ACLs for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDKs to update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
