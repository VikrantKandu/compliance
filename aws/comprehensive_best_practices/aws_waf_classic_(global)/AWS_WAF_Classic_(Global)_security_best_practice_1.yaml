    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets may expose
      sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block Public Access settings.
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to apply changes if necessary.
