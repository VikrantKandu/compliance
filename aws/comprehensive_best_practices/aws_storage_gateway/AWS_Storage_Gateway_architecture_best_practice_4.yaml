    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Review bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to verify no public permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
