    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to restrict public access to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      data access. It is crucial to control access permissions to protect sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the "Access" column for public indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Select the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block public access" settings are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for entries that allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
