    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication. This helps
      prevent unauthorized access in case a user's password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of account
      compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, an attacker with
      a user's password can gain full access to the account, leading to potential
      data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select each user and check if MFA is enabled under the Security Credentials
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the
      user.
