  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and lead to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leaks. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect sensitive data and
      maintain privacy and security standards.
  - Audit: Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list all S3 buckets and check
      their permissions. Verify that no bucket is configured to allow public access
      by reviewing bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs).
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy and ACL to restrict access to authorized users only. Use the AWS Management
      Console or AWS CLI to modify the settings and ensure the bucket is private.
