    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to the
      AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional verification in addition
      to their password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from being compromised, especially
      in the event that a password is stolen or guessed. Without MFA, unauthorized
      users could gain access to critical resources and data.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. For each user, check the "MFA"
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Ensure that all IAM users have a device
      listed under the "MFA" column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 6. In
      the "Assigned MFA device" section, choose "Manage". 7. Follow the on-screen
      instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
