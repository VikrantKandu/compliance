    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password, requiring users to provide a second form
      of verification, such as a code from a mobile app.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access
      to a user's credentials could potentially access and manipulate AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to list all IAM users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying their MFA device status.
    - AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
        <username> for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user you want to enable MFA for.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, click on Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
