    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is stored
      within them.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Public buckets can expose
      data to the internet, making it vulnerable to malicious actors.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
