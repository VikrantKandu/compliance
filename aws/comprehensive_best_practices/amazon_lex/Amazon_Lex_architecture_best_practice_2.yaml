    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in exposure of sensitive data,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
