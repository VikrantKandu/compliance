    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Using the default security
      group can expose instances to unnecessary risks.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Custom security groups
      should be used to restrict traffic based on specific needs.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances.
