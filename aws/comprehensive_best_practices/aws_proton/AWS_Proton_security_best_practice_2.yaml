    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, which
      helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in AWS S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings for any public
      access configurations.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and access configurations to ensure compliance.
