    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
      By default, S3 buckets should have restricted access to prevent data leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket allows public access by checking the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL).
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket ACL for public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for statements allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy and ACL
      settings.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access or use AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
