    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. It is crucial to restrict access to only those
      who need it.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that they
      do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 bucket settings in the AWS Management Console.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
