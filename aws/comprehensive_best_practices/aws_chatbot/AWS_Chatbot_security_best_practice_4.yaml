    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from being accessed by unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data leaks, compliance violations, and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the access permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access
      is granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Block all public access by disabling options that allow public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
