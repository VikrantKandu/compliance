    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to
      gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access
      to a user's password can access AWS resources without additional verification,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized usage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled. This can be verified by checking
      the 'MFA' column for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, click on the user name to open the user details page.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage' and follow the prompts
      to enable and configure MFA for the user.
