    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data
      breaches and compliance violations, especially if sensitive data is stored in
      the bucket.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Review the S3 bucket's permissions and remove any public access configurations.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the bucket's ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Consider using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies for
      more granular access control.
