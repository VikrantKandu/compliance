  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Versioning Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have versioning enabled
      to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in an
      S3 bucket. Versioning helps to recover from both unintended user actions and
      application failures.
  - Rationale: Enabling versioning in S3 buckets is crucial for data protection and
      recovery. It allows you to recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.
      Without versioning, you risk permanent data loss, which can be detrimental to
      business operations and compliance requirements.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on "Properties". 4. Check if the "Versioning" status
      is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-versioning
      --bucket <bucket-name> and verify that the "Status" is "Enabled".
  - Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default on S3 buckets.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you wish to modify. 4. Click on "Properties" and then "Versioning".
      5. Enable versioning by clicking "Enable" and then save changes. 6. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <bucket-name>
      --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled.
