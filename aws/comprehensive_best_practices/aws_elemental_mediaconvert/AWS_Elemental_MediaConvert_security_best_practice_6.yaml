    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Use Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain consistency, compliance, and security.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can lead to security vulnerabilities, inconsistent
      configurations, and non-compliance with organizational policies. Approved AMIs
      are vetted for security and compliance, ensuring they meet organizational standards.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' to view the list of running instances. 4. For each instance,
      check the AMI ID and verify it against the list of approved AMIs maintained
      by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances that are not using approved AMIs. 2. Create
      an AMI from an approved source or select one from the list of approved AMIs.
      3. Terminate the non-compliant instance and launch a new instance using the
      approved AMI.
