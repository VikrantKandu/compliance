    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect
      your AWS resources and data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, a compromised password can lead to unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring an additional
      verification factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the 'Users' section to see which users have MFA enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify MFA devices
      assigned to users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' and then 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
