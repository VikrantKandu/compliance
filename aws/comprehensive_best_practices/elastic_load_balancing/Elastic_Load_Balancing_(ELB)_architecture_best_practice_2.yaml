    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide a
      second form of identification, in addition to their password, to access AWS
      resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring users to provide additional
      verification beyond just a password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      due to compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'Security credentials'
      tab for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
