    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are launched with IAM roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: EC2 instances should be launched with IAM roles to ensure secure
      access to AWS services without embedding credentials in application code.
    Rationale: Using IAM roles with EC2 instances allows for secure and temporary
      access to AWS resources. This minimizes the risk of credential exposure and
      ensures that permissions are managed centrally through IAM policies.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the 'IAM role' column to ensure an IAM role is attached.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws ec2 describe-instances' to verify
      the 'IamInstanceProfile' attribute for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have an IAM role attached.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances without IAM roles.
    - Create or identify an appropriate IAM role with the necessary permissions.
    - Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instances via the AWS Management Console or CLI.
    - Update any application code to leverage the IAM role for AWS service access
      instead of embedded credentials.
