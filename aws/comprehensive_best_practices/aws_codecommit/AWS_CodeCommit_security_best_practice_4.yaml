    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets
      should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required for a specific
      use case.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private helps protect data from unauthorized access,
      reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection
      regulations. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive information,
      resulting in potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access unless explicitly required.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to programmatically check the bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) for public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - For any bucket found to be publicly accessible, review and modify the bucket
      policy and ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK to update the bucket settings.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
