    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an additional
      layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication,
      typically a temporary code generated by a mobile app or hardware device, in
      addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access. Without MFA, if an IAM user's
      password is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to the AWS account.
      MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring an additional
      verification step.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. If any user does not have MFA enabled,
      record their details for further action.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Click on the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage'
      next to 'Assigned MFA device'. 6. Follow the prompts to assign and activate
      an MFA device for the user.
