    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public access
      reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - For each public bucket, go to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and navigate to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
