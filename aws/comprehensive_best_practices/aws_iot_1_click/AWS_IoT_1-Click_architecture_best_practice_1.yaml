    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict public
      access to maintain data confidentiality.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces
      the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check the public access settings for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the S3 service and choose the bucket you want to secure.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Save changes to apply the settings.
