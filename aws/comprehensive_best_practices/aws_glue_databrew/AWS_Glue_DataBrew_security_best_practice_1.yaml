    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a password to secure access to AWS accounts. This check ensures that
      MFA is enabled for all IAM users to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, the account
      could be accessed by unauthorized individuals, leading to potential data breaches
      and security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab for MFA device status.
    - Verify that an MFA device is assigned and enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Select 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to assign and enable
      an MFA device.
