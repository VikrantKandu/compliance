    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of
      a username and password, requiring users to provide a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA is recommended to enhance security for user accounts.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially
      if passwords are compromised.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under
      'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign and
      activate an MFA device for the user.
