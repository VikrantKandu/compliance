    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access
      to the account, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all AWS resources and services,
      and if compromised, can lead to severe security breaches. Enabling MFA adds
      an extra layer of security that can prevent unauthorized access even if the
      root account password is compromised.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user with administrative
      privileges. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select
      'Dashboard'. 4. Check the 'Security Status' section to see if MFA is enabled
      for the root account. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary
      and verify that 'AccountMFAEnabled' is set to true.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. In the 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)' section, choose 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the prompts to complete the
      MFA device setup. 5. Test the MFA configuration to ensure it is working correctly.
