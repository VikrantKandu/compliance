    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that an IAM password policy is enabled within
      your AWS account. A strong password policy helps protect user accounts from
      unauthorized access by enforcing complexity and expiration requirements.
    Rationale: Implementing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources by enforcing password strength and rotation. Without
      a password policy, user accounts may be vulnerable to brute force attacks or
      misuse.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Verify that a password policy is configured and enabled.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Account settings.
    - Set and enable a password policy that includes requirements for password length,
      complexity, and expiration.
