    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Public exposure of
      data may lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential financial and
      reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policies for any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACLs.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users, roles, or IP
      addresses.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly monitor and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
