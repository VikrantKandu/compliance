    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users with console access have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users
      to provide a second form of authentication, typically a code from a mobile device,
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen or guessed, an attacker can gain
      full access to the AWS management console, potentially leading to unauthorized
      access and control over AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device.
    - Repeat the process for all users without MFA enabled.
