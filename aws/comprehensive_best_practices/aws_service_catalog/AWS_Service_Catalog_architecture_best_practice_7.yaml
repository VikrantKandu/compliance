    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in All Regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to provide a record
      of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in your account. CloudTrail
      logs are crucial for security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance
      auditing.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions helps ensure that all AWS API calls
      are logged, which is essential for detecting unauthorized access attempts and
      other suspicious activities. Without CloudTrail, you may not have sufficient
      data to investigate security incidents or demonstrate compliance with regulatory
      requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Verify that a trail is created and enabled for all regions.
    - Check that the trail is configured to log all management and data events.
    - Ensure that the trail is integrated with CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring.
    Default Value: By default, AWS CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Ensure the trail is configured to log management and data events.
    - Enable CloudWatch Logs integration for the trail to monitor logs in real-time.
