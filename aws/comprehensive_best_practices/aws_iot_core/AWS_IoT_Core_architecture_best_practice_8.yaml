    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting
      public access mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Public Access' column.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Click on the bucket name that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' or adjust the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
