    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a password policy is enabled for AWS IAM
      users. A password policy enforces password complexity and expiration, which
      helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, which can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without
      a password policy, users might set weak passwords that are vulnerable to attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select 'Account Settings'.
    - Check if a password policy is configured with requirements for minimum length,
      complexity, and expiration.
    Default Value: No password policy is enforced by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select 'Account Settings'.
    - Click 'Change' next to 'Password Policy'.
    - Configure the password policy to require a minimum length, include at least
      one uppercase letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric character.
    - Set password expiration and reuse conditions as per your organization's security
      requirements.
    - Save the changes.
