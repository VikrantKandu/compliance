    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to enhance security by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security, reducing the
      risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised passwords
      could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      MFA devices and verify their association with IAM users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
