    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and breaches. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible protects sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential exploitation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions to ensure that public access is not allowed.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) for public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review bucket policies for public access statements.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Modify the ACL to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      and bucket levels.
    - Regularly review bucket settings to ensure compliance with access policies.
