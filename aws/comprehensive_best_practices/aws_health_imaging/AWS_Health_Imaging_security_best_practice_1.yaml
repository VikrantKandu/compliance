    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private helps
      protect data from being exposed to the public internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket ACLs to verify that they do not grant public read or write
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Modify the bucket ACLs to ensure that they do not grant public read or write
      permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access settings
      from being applied to the bucket.
