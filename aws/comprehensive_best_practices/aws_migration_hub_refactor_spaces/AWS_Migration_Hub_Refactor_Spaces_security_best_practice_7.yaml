  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly available data can be exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to potential data loss and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the Amazon S3
      service. 3. Review the list of S3 buckets and check the 'Public Access' column.
      4. For each bucket, check the bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs)
      to ensure there are no public permissions granted. 5. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the S3 bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on 'Permissions' and review
      the bucket policy and ACLs. 4. Remove any statements in the bucket policy that
      allow public access. 5. Adjust the ACLs to remove public access permissions.
      6. Enable 'Block public access' settings to prevent future public access configurations.
