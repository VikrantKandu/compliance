    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps maintain
      data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block Public Access" settings
      are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and ACLs to confirm that they do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Regularly audit bucket settings to ensure compliance.
