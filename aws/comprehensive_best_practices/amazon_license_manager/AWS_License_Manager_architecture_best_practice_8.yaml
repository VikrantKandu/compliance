    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless
      explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive
      data and comply with privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for all buckets.
    - Verify that no bucket policies grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Update any ACLs to restrict public access.
