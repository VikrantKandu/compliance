    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can expose data to the
      internet, leading to potential data loss or exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have any public access settings enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to review the access control list and bucket policy for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block Public Access settings and ensure that all public access settings
      are blocked.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and access control list to restrict public
      access.
