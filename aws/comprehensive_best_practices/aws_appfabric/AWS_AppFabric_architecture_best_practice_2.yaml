    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to provide two or more verification factors to gain access, reducing the risk
      of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account enhances security by requiring an
      additional verification step beyond just a password. This reduces the risk of
      account compromise due to stolen or guessed passwords. Without MFA, the root
      account is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches
      or unauthorized changes to AWS resources.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user with necessary
      permissions. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose
      'Users'. 4. Select the root account. 5. Check the 'Security Credentials' tab
      for MFA device status. 6. Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the 'My Security Credentials' page. 3. Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)', choose 'Activate MFA'. 4. Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device
      to the root account. 5. Confirm the MFA device is functioning by testing access.
