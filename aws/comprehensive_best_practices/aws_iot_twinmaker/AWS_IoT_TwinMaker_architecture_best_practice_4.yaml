    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure,
      unauthorized access, and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
      Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data
      leakage and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the 'Permissions' tab for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify any bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm they do
      not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Block public access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
