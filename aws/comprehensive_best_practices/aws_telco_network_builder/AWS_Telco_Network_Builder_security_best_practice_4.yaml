    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      access and data leakage.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are not
      publicly accessible helps protect data from unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to confirm they are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Review and adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does not allow public access.
