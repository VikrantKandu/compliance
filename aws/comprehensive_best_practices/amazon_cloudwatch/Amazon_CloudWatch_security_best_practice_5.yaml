    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFormation Stacks are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFormation stacks have encryption
      enabled for sensitive data. Encryption helps protect data at rest and in transit
      from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on CloudFormation stacks helps safeguard sensitive
      information and reduces the risk of data breaches. Without encryption, data
      may be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to potential security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select each stack and review the stack's resources for encryption settings.
    - Verify that all resources, such as S3 buckets and EBS volumes, have encryption
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFormation stacks do not have encryption enabled
      for all resources.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the resources within the CloudFormation stack that require encryption.
    - Modify the CloudFormation template to include encryption settings for each resource.
    - Update the stack with the modified template to apply the encryption settings.
