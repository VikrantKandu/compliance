    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      even if the password is compromised. Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks, increasing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized activities.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'Security
      credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click
      'Manage MFA'. 6. Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
