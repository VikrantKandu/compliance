    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access helps
      to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the permissions tab. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access. 5. Use AWS
      CLI or SDK to run aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy to
      verify the bucket's access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Review the bucket's permissions and remove any public access settings.
      2. Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles. 3.
      Use S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access at the account
      or bucket level.
