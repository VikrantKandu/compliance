    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read
      or write access unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can
      lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible,
      you reduce the risk of data breaches and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have any public access granted through bucket
      policies or ACLs.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access setting to prevent future public access configurations.
