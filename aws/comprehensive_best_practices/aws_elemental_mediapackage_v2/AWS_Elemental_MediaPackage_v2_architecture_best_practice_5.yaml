    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard sensitive data from
      unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets ensures that data is protected against
      unauthorized access, both at rest and in transit. Without encryption, data can
      be vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access, especially if access
      controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify that default encryption is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption to check
      the encryption status of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the properties of the bucket and enable default encryption.
    - Choose the encryption method, such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
