    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password but also an additional
      form of verification. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users
      to enhance security.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to a security breach. Enabling
      MFA helps protect sensitive resources and data from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
