    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance account security by requiring an additional authentication
      factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an extra layer of security, reducing the risk
      of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, user accounts are more
      susceptible to compromise through password theft or phishing attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check the 'Security Credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user without MFA, go to the 'Security Credentials' tab and click 'Manage
      MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA, choosing a virtual MFA device, U2F security
      key, or hardware MFA device.
