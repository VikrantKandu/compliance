    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can be easily exploited by attackers, leading to data leaks and compliance
      issues.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      bucket ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for any public access policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public read or write permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings on the bucket to prevent future public access
      configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
