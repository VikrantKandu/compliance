    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets can be configured to allow public access, which
      can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates this risk by restricting access to authorized users only.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' settings
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Action 3: Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Action 4: Modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Action 5: Enable 'Block all public access' settings for the bucket.
