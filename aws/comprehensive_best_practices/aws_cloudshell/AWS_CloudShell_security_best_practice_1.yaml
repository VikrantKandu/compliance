    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private and Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private and that
      data stored in them is encrypted. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized access to data, and
      encryption safeguards data at rest. Failure to implement these measures can
      lead to data breaches, legal penalties, and loss of customer trust.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled by checking the properties tab
      of each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but encryption is not enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Set the bucket policy to private by removing any public access permissions.
    - Enable server-side encryption on each bucket by selecting the desired encryption
      method under the properties tab.
