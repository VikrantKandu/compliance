    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail should be enabled in all AWS regions to ensure all account
      activity is logged and monitored. This is crucial for security and compliance,
      as it provides a history of AWS API calls for your account, including actions
      taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and
      other AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that any unauthorized or
      malicious activity across any region is logged and can be reviewed. Without
      this, there is a risk of missing critical security events that could indicate
      a breach or unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Ensure that a trail is created that applies to all regions.
    - Verify that the trail is logging management events.
    - Check that the trail is configured to deliver logs to an S3 bucket.
    Default Value: By default, CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is configured to log management events.
    - Set up the trail to deliver logs to an S3 bucket for storage and analysis.
