  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps maintain data
      privacy and security.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket. 4. Ensure
      that the block public access settings are enabled. 5. Verify that no bucket
      policies or ACLs allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Enable block
      all public access settings. 5. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to
      remove public access permissions.
