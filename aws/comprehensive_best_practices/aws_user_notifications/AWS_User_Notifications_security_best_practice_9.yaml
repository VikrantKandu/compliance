    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security to the AWS environment.
      MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access,
      enhancing the security of user sign-ins.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts. Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen or guessed, an attacker
      can gain full access to the user's permissions, potentially leading to data
      breaches or unauthorized changes to the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
