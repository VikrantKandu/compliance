    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring proper access controls helps protect sensitive information
      and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the policy status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      public access.
    - Consider using S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
