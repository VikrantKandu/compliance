    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring additional authentication beyond just a password.
      This helps protect sensitive AWS resources from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen, their account can be easily accessed,
      potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions within your AWS
      environment.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Review the MFA column for each user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab, and then choose Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
