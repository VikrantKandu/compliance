    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of data breaches
      and unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the public access configuration.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Ensure that the block public access settings are enabled for the bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> --policy
      <policy-json> to apply a policy that restricts public access.
