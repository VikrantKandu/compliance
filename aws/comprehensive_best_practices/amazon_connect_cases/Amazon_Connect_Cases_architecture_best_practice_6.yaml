    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to
      unauthorized data access, which can result in data breaches, financial loss,
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no buckets have public access
      enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public access
      permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
