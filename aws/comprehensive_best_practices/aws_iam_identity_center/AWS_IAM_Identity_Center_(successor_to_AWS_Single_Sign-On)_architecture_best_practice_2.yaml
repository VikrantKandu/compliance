  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent
      unauthorized data exposure. This includes checking bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) to ensure they are configured to block public access unless
      explicitly required and justified.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      minimizes the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions. 4. Verify that the bucket
      policy and ACL do not grant public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> to check the policy status.
      6. Confirm that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for the bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the business
      need for such access. 2. If public access is not required, update the bucket
      policy and ACL to remove public access permissions. 3. Enable Block Public Access
      settings for the bucket. 4. Regularly review bucket policies and permissions
      to ensure compliance.
