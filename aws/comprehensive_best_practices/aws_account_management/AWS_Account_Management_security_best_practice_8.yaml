    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      not only a password but also a second form of verification to access AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker could
      gain full access to the AWS account. MFA adds an additional layer of security,
      making unauthorized access much more difficult.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Review the 'MFA' column to verify
      that MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)', choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow the instructions
      to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
