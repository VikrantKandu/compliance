    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to exposure of sensitive data.
      Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the Permissions tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
