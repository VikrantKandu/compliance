    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps maintain
      data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) are set to allow
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Apply bucket policies that explicitly deny public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access settings at the
      account level or bucket level.
