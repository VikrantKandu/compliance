    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
      It is crucial to restrict access to only authorized users or roles.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible reduces the risk of data exposure and complies with security best
      practices.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access settings for the
      bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
