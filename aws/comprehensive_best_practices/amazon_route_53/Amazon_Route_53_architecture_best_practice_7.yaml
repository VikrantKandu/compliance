    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks or unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private protects data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block
      public access" settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible. 5.
      Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" for the S3 bucket. 2. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      3. Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
