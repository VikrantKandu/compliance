    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private,
      preventing unauthorized public access to data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to anyone on the
      internet, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can change this setting.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl
      private to set the ACL to private.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api delete-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to remove any existing bucket policy that grants public access.
