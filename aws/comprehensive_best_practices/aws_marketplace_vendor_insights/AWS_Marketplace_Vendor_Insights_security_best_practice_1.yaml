    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to provide a second form of authentication, in addition to
      their password, which helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker with stolen credentials
      could gain full access to the account, leading to potential data breaches and
      unauthorized activities.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Choose Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
        to list all users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select Users.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab and select Manage MFA Device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
