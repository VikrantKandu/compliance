  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Enable Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for all EC2 instances
      to provide additional CloudWatch metrics with a 1-minute granularity.
  - Rationale: Enabling detailed monitoring allows for more granular metrics, which
      can help in identifying performance issues and trends. Without detailed monitoring,
      metrics are only available at 5-minute intervals, which might not be sufficient
      for timely detection and response to issues.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left navigation pane. 4. Check each instance to
      ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI
      command aws ec2 describe-instances and verify that Monitoring.State is set to
      enabled for each instance.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances have basic monitoring enabled, which
      provides metrics at 5-minute intervals.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left navigation pane. 4. Choose the instance(s)
      for which you want to enable detailed monitoring. 5. Click on 'Actions', then
      'Monitor and troubleshoot', and select 'Enable detailed monitoring'. 6. Confirm
      the action to enable detailed monitoring for the selected instance(s).
