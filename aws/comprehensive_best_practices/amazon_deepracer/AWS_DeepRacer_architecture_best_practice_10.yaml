  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to provide
      an additional layer of security when accessing AWS resources. Enabling MFA helps
      protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials by requiring
      a second form of authentication. Without MFA, user accounts are vulnerable to
      attacks such as phishing or password guessing.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Click
      'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA device'. 7. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA
      device to the user.
