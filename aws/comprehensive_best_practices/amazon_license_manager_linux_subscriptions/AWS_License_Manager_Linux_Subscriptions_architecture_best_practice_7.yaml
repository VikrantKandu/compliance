    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. Default security groups allow all inbound traffic from other instances
      in the same group, which can lead to unintended access and potential security
      vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risk due to its permissive settings. By ensuring instances are associated with
      custom security groups, you can enforce more restrictive and specific access
      controls, reducing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the Security Groups column to ensure it is not using
      the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no specific group is selected.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific, necessary rules for your application.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove any unnecessary rules from the default security group or disassociate
      it from instances.
