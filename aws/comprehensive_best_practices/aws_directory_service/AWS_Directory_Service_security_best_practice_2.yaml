    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to provide an additional layer of security beyond just passwords.
    Rationale: "Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user\u2019\
      s credentials, reducing the risk of unauthorized access in case of compromised\
      \ passwords. Without MFA, attackers can gain access to AWS resources with just\
      \ a stolen password."
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - On the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
