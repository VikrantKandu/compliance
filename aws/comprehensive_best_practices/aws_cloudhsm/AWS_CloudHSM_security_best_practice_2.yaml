    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data leakage and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket ACLs and ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and edit the "Block public access" settings.
    - Enable "Block all public access" and save changes.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
