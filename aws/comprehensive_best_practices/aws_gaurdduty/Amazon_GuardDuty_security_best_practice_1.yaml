    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS resources by requiring users to provide more than one form
      of verification. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect sensitive data
      and resources.
    Rationale: Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access,
      which can lead to data breaches and other security incidents. MFA significantly
      reduces the risk of account compromise.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
