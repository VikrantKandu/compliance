    Title: Ensure CloudFormation Stacks Have Termination Protection Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS CloudFormation stacks have termination
      protection enabled to prevent accidental deletion of critical resources.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection on CloudFormation stacks prevents accidental
      deletion of the stack and its associated resources, which can lead to service
      disruption and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - For each stack, check if termination protection is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation describe-stacks and
      review the EnableTerminationProtection field for each stack.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is not enabled on CloudFormation
      stacks.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
    - Select the stack you want to protect.
    - Click on the "Actions" button and select "Enable Termination Protection".
    - Confirm the change to enable termination protection.
