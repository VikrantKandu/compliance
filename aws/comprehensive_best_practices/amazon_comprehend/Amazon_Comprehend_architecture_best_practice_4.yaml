    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not use the default security group. Default
      security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which can pose a security
      risk if not managed properly.
    Rationale: Using default security groups increases the risk of unauthorized access
      to EC2 instances, as they allow unrestricted traffic. This can lead to data
      breaches or unauthorized actions on the instances.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Click on "Instances" to view all running instances.
    - Check the security group associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be assigned to the default security
      group if not specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance's needs.
    - Assign the new security group to the instance.
    - Remove the instance from the default security group.
