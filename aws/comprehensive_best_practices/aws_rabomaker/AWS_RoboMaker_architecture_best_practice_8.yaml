    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and should be restricted
      unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Restricting access to only necessary parties mitigates
      the risk of data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and review their permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket's policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Utilize AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
    - Implement IAM policies that restrict access to authorized users only.
