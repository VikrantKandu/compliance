    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access
      to only authorized users minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket ACL is not granting public-read or public-read-write
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public-read or public-read-write
      permissions.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
