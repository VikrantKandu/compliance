    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose sensitive information to the internet, leading to compliance
      violations and security risks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the "Access" column for any buckets
      marked as "Public". 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and navigate
      to the "Permissions" tab. 5. Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow
      public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
      2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions"
      tab and review the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List (ACL)". 4. Remove
      any statements in the bucket policy that grant public access. 5. Ensure the
      ACL does not grant "Everyone" permissions. 6. Save the changes to secure the
      bucket.
