    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound traffic. Using a custom
      security group with specific rules enhances security by limiting access.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound traffic, which poses
      a significant security risk. Restricting access through custom security groups
      reduces the attack surface and protects instances from unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the left menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Ensure no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Remove the default security group from the instances to ensure compliance.
