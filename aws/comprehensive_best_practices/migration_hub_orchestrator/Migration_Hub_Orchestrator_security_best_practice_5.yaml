    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each
        bucket.
    - Step 4: Verify that there are no public access settings enabled.
    - Step 5: Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Action 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Action 4: Adjust the bucket permissions and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Action 5: Update the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
