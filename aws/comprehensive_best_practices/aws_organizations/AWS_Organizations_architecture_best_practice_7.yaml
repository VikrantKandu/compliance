    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private helps protect sensitive information from
      being accessed by unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
      data breaches and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible by checking the bucket policy and
      access control list (ACL).
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private, but configurations may
      change based on user actions.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, modify the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI or Management Console to update the bucket settings to ensure
      it is private.
