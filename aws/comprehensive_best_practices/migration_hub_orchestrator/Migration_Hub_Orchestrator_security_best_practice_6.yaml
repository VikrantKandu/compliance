    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access,
      which could potentially expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public prevents accidental
      data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Step 5: Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Click on 'Permissions'.
    - Step 3: Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Step 4: Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow
        public access.
