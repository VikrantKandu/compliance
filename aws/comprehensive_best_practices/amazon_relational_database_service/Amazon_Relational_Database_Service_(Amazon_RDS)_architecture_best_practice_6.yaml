    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an additional
      layer of security to user accounts by requiring a second form of authentication
      beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances the security of AWS accounts by
      reducing the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA, a malicious actor
      with access to a user's password could gain full access to the user's permissions,
      leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled. This can be done by checking
      the "MFA" column in the user list or by selecting each user and reviewing their
      security credentials.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and navigate to the "Security credentials"
      tab.
    - Click "Manage" under "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA for the user.
