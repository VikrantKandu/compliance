    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect
      AWS accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
      If an IAM user's credentials are compromised, MFA provides an additional layer
      of security that can prevent unauthorized access to AWS services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom MFA needs to be enabled.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
