    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect
      data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access settings enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check for
        public policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket's permissions and remove any public access settings.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to specific users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
