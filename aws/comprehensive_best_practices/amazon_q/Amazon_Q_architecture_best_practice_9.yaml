    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Securely Configured
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured with appropriate
      security settings to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Properly securing S3 buckets is critical to protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data leaks, financial
      loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Ensure that bucket policies and ACLs are not granting public access unless absolutely
      necessary.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    - Check for the presence of bucket logging to monitor access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Enable server-side encryption for all buckets.
    - Implement bucket logging to track access.
    - Regularly review bucket configurations and permissions.
