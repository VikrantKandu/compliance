    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, potentially
      leading to data leakage or compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for any buckets marked
      as Public.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open its properties.
    - Under the Permissions tab, verify that the bucket does not have any public access
      settings enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block Public Access settings and ensure that all public access options
      are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Save the changes to apply the updated permissions.
