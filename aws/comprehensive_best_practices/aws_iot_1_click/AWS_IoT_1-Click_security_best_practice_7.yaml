    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for your AWS environment by requiring a second form of authentication in addition
      to a password. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access, even
      if a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, a compromised password could allow attackers
      to gain full access to your AWS environment, leading to potential data breaches
      and unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA enabled' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the instructions to enable MFA for the
      user.
