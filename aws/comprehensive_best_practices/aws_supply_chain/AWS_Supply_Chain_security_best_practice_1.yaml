    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to security and compliance risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket policy and ACLs to restrict
      access.
    - Remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to apply the necessary changes.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for the account to prevent
      future public access configurations.
