    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
      data breaches. It is crucial to restrict public access to maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. By ensuring buckets are
      not publicly accessible, organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized
      data access and protect sensitive information.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the "Permissions" tab. 4. Ensure that "Block all
      public access" is enabled. 5. Check the bucket policy and access control list
      (ACL) for any public access permissions. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify bucket ACL settings. 7. Use
      the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. In the AWS Management Console, go to the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable
      "Block all public access." 4. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to
      remove any public access permissions. 5. Consider using AWS Identity and Access
      Management (IAM) roles and policies to control access to the bucket.
