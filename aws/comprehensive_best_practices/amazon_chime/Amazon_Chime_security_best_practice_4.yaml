    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if unauthorized
      users gain access to sensitive information. Restricting public access helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions to ensure that
      'Block all public access' is enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies and Access
      Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access'. 6. Review and update bucket policies
      and ACLs to restrict public access.
