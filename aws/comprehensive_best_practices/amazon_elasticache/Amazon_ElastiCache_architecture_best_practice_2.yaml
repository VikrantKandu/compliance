    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to ensure security and compliance standards are met. Approved
      AMIs are those that have been vetted for security vulnerabilities and compliance
      requirements.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps to ensure that the instances are secure and
      compliant with organizational policies. Unapproved AMIs may contain vulnerabilities
      or configurations that do not meet security standards, posing a risk to the
      environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running EC2 instances.
    - Check the AMI ID used by each instance.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by the
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, there is no restriction on the AMIs that can be used
      to launch EC2 instances.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances that are not using approved AMIs.
    - Stop the non-compliant instances.
    - Launch new instances using approved AMIs.
    - Terminate the non-compliant instances after verifying that the new instances
      are functioning correctly.
