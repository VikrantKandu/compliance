    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to data exposure. It is crucial to restrict access to only authorized
      users to protect sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are not public
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and check for any public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
