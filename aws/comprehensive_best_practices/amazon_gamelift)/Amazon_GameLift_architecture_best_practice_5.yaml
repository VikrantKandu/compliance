    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      to prevent data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible,
      you mitigate the risk of data breaches and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings for the bucket and ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only.
