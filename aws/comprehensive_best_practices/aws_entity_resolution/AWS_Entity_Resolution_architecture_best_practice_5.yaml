    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA provides an additional layer of protection on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised accounts by requiring
      an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to unauthorized access through stolen or guessed credentials.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 4. Choose
      the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)'
      section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 6. Follow the prompts to configure the
      MFA device.
