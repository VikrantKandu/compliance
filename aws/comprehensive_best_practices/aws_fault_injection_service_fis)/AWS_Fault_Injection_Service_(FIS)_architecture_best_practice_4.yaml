    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS environment by requiring not only a password and username but also
      something that only the user has on them, i.e., an MFA device. This significantly
      reduces the risk of stolen credentials being used to gain unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      accounts and resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker can easily gain access to sensitive data and resources, potentially
      leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices and
      aws iam get-user to verify MFA status for each user programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the individual user and select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
