  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires the user to
      present two or more separate forms of identification, enhancing the security
      of the account.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. If an attacker gains access to the root credentials, they
      would still need the MFA device to log in. Failure to implement MFA can lead
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select 'Dashboard'. 4. Check the 'Security Status'
      section for 'MFA on root account'. 5. Verify that MFA is enabled for the root
      account.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM service. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Dashboard'. 4. In the
      'Security Status' section, choose 'Activate MFA on your root account'. 5. Follow
      the steps to set up and activate MFA.
