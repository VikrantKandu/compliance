    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in S3. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data leaks, compliance violations, and other security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to programmatically check bucket policies
      and ACLs for public access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not grant public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public
      access.
    - Consider enabling AWS Config rules to continuously monitor and remediate public
      access settings.
