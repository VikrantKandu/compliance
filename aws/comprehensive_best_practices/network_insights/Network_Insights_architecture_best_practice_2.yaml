    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to
        review the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
        to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to edit the bucket permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to apply stricter policies and ACLs.
