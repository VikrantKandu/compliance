  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Verify that neither the bucket policy nor the ACL grants public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
