    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access
      Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username
      and password, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users
      to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials and sensitive AWS resources
      from unauthorized access. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
