    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Limiting access to only authorized users helps
      protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that there are no public
      access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket's ACL.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access using aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket ACL.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict access to authorized users only.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
