    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: By restricting public access to S3 buckets, you reduce the risk of
      data leaks and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited
      by attackers to steal or manipulate sensitive data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy grants public access and that the "Block all public
      access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public
      access.
