    Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: CloudTrail should be enabled in all regions to ensure that all API
      calls are logged, providing a comprehensive audit trail for security analysis
      and compliance auditing.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions ensures that no API activity goes
      unlogged, which helps in detecting unauthorized access attempts and provides
      a historical record for forensic investigations. Without this, there is a risk
      of missing crucial security events.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      service. 3. Verify that there is at least one trail created and it is logging
      events in all regions. 4. Ensure that the trail is configured to deliver logs
      to an S3 bucket. 5. Check that the trail is set to log both management and data
      events.
    Default Value: By default, CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the CloudTrail
      service. 3. Create a new trail or modify an existing one to enable logging in
      all regions. 4. Configure the trail to deliver logs to an S3 bucket. 5. Ensure
      the trail is set to log both management and data events.
