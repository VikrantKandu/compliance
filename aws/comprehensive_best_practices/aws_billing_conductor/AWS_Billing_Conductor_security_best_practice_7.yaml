    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA provides an extra layer of security
      by requiring a second form of authentication, which helps protect against unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials being used to access AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who
      obtains a user's password can gain full access to the account, potentially leading
      to data breaches and unauthorized activities.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check if MFA
      is enabled by looking for a green checkmark in the 'MFA' column. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to list all users
      and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to use MFA.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user
      for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab, and
      then choose 'Manage' next to Assigned MFA device. 6. Follow the prompts to assign
      a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
