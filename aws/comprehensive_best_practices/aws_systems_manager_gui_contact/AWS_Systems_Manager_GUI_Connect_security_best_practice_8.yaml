    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access permissions enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the "Block public access" settings to block all public access.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
