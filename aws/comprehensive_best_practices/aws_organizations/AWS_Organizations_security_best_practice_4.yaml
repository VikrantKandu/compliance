    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches.
      It is essential to configure S3 bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs)
      to restrict public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket policy or ACL allows public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to review each bucket's ACL and policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - For each S3 bucket, ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy and ACL
      to restrict public access.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future configurations
      that allow public access.
