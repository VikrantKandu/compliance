    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring a second form of authentication beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, an attacker with stolen credentials can gain unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized
      operations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "Security Credentials" tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security Credentials" tab and click "Manage" under "Multi-factor
      Authentication (MFA)".
    - Follow the steps to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
