    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data and increase the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data, resulting in data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are
      private by default minimizes these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL settings do not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to adjust settings under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access unless necessary.
    - Consider enabling "Block Public Access" settings for the entire account or specific
      buckets.
