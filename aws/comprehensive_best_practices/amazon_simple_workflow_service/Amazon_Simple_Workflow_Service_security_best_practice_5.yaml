    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Step 4: Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Step 5: Check the bucket's access control list (ACL) to ensure it is not set
        to public.
    - Step 6: Confirm that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the
        account and individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable "Block Public Access" settings at the account and bucket level.
    - Action 2: Review and update bucket policies to remove any statements that allow
        public access.
    - Action 3: Adjust the bucket ACL to restrict public access.
    - Action 4: Regularly monitor and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance
        with security policies.
