    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential data breaches,
      as unauthorized users may be able to view or modify sensitive data.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to sensitive information being accessed by unintended parties, which can result
      in data loss or compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled under the "Permissions" tab.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the access control list for public grants.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and disable public access settings.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Implement bucket policies that restrict access to only specific IAM users or
      roles.
