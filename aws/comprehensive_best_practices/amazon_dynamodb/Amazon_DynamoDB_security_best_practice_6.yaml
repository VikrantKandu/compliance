    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and exposure of sensitive information. Restricting public access
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review bucket ACLs and bucket policies to confirm no public access permissions
      are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Block public access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
