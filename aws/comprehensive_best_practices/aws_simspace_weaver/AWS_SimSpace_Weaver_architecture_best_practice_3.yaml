    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      by requiring a second form of authentication. Without MFA, unauthorized access
      to AWS resources is more likely if credentials are leaked or compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        to verify MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage MFA device' and follow the prompts to assign and activate an
      MFA device for the user.
