    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to use server-side
      encryption to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest is a fundamental security measure to protect
      sensitive information from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data stored
      in S3 can be vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access, especially if access
      controls are misconfigured.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab. 4. Ensure that "Default encryption"
      is enabled and configured with either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS
      Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to configure. 4. Go to the "Properties" tab. 5.
      Under "Default encryption," enable server-side encryption and choose either
      SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS. 6. Save the changes.
