    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password. This
      helps protect against unauthorized access, even if a user's password is compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for the MFA device column.
      If the column shows "Not assigned," MFA is not enabled for that user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users, and select the user for whom you want
      to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - In the Multi-factor authentication section, choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
