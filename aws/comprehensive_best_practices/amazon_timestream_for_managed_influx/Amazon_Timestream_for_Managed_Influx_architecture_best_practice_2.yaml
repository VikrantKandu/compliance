    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Public
      access can be granted through bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Verify that public access is blocked and no public permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust ACL settings to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
