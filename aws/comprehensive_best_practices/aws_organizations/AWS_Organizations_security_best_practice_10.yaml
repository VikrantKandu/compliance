    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is critical to prevent unauthorized
      access and data leaks. Misconfigured S3 buckets have been the cause of numerous
      data breaches, exposing sensitive information to the public.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
