    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
      Restricting access to only necessary users and applications minimizes security
      risks and ensures data privacy.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket list and identify any bucket with a public access indicator.
      4. For each bucket, click on the Permissions tab. 5. Check the Block public
      access settings to ensure that public access is restricted. 6. Verify that bucket
      policies and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the non-compliant bucket. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Click
      on Edit under Block public access and enable all options to block public access.
      5. Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
