  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps safeguard sensitive
      data by encrypting it using AWS-managed keys or customer-provided keys.
  - Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets protects data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is
      vulnerable to exposure if unauthorized access is gained. This check helps ensure
      compliance with data protection regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Properties" tab. 4. Check the "Default
      encryption" section to ensure server-side encryption is enabled. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify encryption settings.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that requires encryption. 4. Click on the "Properties"
      tab and locate the "Default encryption" section. 5. Choose "Enable" and select
      the appropriate encryption option (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C). 6. Save the changes.
