    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should have proper
      access controls to prevent public access unless explicitly required for use
      cases such as hosting static websites.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized access to sensitive information. By restricting public access,
      you mitigate the risk of exposing data to the internet and ensure that only
      authorized users have access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' settings are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket ACL and confirm that it does not allow public access.
    - Verify the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure there are no policies allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket settings to
      block all public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Educate users and administrators on the importance of maintaining proper access
      controls for S3 buckets.
