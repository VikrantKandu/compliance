    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound traffic. This check ensures that instances
      are using custom security groups with specific rules to enhance security.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks, as it allows all inbound traffic by default. This can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the instances.
    - Attach the newly created custom security group to the instances.
