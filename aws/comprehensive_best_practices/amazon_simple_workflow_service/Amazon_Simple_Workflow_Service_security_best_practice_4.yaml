    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to your AWS resources. Without MFA, users are more vulnerable to credential
      theft and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by selecting the user and reviewing the
      "Security credentials" tab.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, click on "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device."
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
