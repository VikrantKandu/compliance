  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private by default minimizes these risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab. 4. Verify that "Block
      all public access" settings are enabled. 5. Check the bucket policy and access
      control lists (ACLs) to ensure there are no public permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Enable "Block all public access" for each S3 bucket in the AWS
      Management Console. 2. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove
      any public access permissions. 3. Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure
      compliance with security best practices.
