    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious users
      to access or modify sensitive data. Restricting access helps protect data integrity
      and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket and ensure it is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove public access.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
