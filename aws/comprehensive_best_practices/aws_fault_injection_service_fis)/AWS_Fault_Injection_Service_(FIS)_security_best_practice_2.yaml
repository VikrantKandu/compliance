    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
      By default, S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required
      and justified.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      the risk of accidental exposure and enhances data security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with no public access permissions
      set.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the permissions to restrict
      access.
    - Remove any public access policies or ACLs from the bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI or console to update the bucket policy to deny public access.
    - Implement bucket policies that restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
