    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access and data exposure. By default, S3 buckets
      should be private, and access should be granted explicitly.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private minimizes the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACL settings for each bucket to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    - Verify that there are no public access block settings that are disabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket policy or ACL
      to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and each bucket to prevent
      public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
