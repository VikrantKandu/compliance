    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or Access Control
      Lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure it does not grant public permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting for the bucket in the S3 console to
      prevent future public access configurations.
