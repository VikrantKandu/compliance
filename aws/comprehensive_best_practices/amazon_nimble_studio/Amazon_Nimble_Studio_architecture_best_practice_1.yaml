    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be enabled for all IAM users
      to provide an additional layer of security. This prevents unauthorized access
      even if a password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - On the user details page, choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), choose Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
