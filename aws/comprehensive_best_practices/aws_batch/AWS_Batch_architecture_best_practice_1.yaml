  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are private and not publicly
      accessible. S3 buckets should be configured to prevent unauthorized access to
      sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and potential data loss. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks by restricting access to authorized users only.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that the bucket
      policy does not allow public access. 5. Confirm that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket
      policy to remove public access permissions. 2. Enable the "Block all public
      access" setting for the bucket. 3. Regularly review and audit bucket permissions
      to ensure compliance.
