  - ID: AWS-EC2-001
  - Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      unrestricted access to and from the instances. This can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the "Security groups" column.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
  - Remediation:
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules as per
      your security policy.
    - Associate the custom security group with your EC2 instances.
    - Remove the default security group association from the instances.
