    Title: Ensure IAM Policies Are Attached to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that IAM policies are attached to groups or roles instead
      of directly to users. This practice simplifies management and improves security
      by reducing the complexity of policy assignments.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to difficulty in managing
      permissions and increase the risk of excessive permissions. By using groups
      or roles, permissions can be managed more efficiently and consistently.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM users and their attached policies.
    - Verify that policies are attached to groups or roles rather than directly to
      individual users.
    Default Value: Policies may be attached directly to users by default if not configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify users with directly attached policies.
    - Create IAM groups or roles with equivalent policies.
    - Attach the policies to the appropriate groups or roles.
    - Detach the policies from the individual users and add them to the groups or
      roles.
