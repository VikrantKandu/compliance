    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring that buckets are not
      public helps protect against unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
