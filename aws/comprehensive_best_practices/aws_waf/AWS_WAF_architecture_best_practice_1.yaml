  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates this
      risk.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Access' column to ensure it is not set to 'Public'.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private when created.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, modify the bucket policy to remove any public
      access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings to block
      all public access.
