    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users in your AWS account have Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and
      password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      prevent unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to the user's permissions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the MFA column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the username of the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor authentication (MFA), choose Assign MFA device.
    - Follow the prompts to select and configure an MFA device for the user.
