    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict access to only trusted entities.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data access, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not public protects
      sensitive data and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure public access is restricted. 5. Verify bucket policies
      and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public
      access. 2. Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket. 3. Regularly
      audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
