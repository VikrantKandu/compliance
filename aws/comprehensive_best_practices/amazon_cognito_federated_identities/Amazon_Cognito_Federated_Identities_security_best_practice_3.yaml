  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group in a VPC. The default security group allows all inbound
      and outbound traffic, which can pose a security risk.
  - Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended open access
      to EC2 instances, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
      breaches. It is recommended to use custom security groups with specific rules
      to control inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that none of the instances are using the
      default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules. 3. Associate
      the new security group with the affected EC2 instances. 4. Remove the default
      security group association from these instances.
