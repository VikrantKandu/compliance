  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of accidental data leaks.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets
      marked as 'Public'. 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name. 5. Go to the
      'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block public access' settings. 6. Ensure that
      the 'Block all public access' option is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Click
      on 'Edit' under 'Block public access'. 5. Enable 'Block all public access' and
      save changes. 6. Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public
      access.
