  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Within a VPC
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual
      Private Cloud (VPC). VPCs provide a secure and isolated network environment
      for your instances, allowing for better control over inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC is recommended for enhanced security
      and control. Instances outside a VPC are exposed to the public internet, increasing
      the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. VPCs allow you
      to define security groups and network ACLs, providing additional layers of protection.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left-hand menu. 4. Check the VPC ID column to ensure
      all instances have a VPC assigned. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances
      and verify the presence of a VPC ID in the output for each instance.
  - Default Value: By default, instances are launched in the default VPC if one is
      available in the region.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify any instances not within a VPC. 2. Create a new VPC if
      necessary, using the VPC Dashboard. 3. Stop the instance and take a snapshot
      of any volumes. 4. Launch a new instance within the VPC, using the snapshot
      to restore data. 5. Update any necessary configurations, such as security groups
      and route tables, to match the original setup.
