    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in your AWS account. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to present two or more separate forms of identification before
      accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If MFA is not enabled, compromised credentials can
      lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", choose "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
