    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket to review.
    - Step 4: Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 5: Check the "Block public access (bucket settings)" section to ensure
        that all public access is blocked.
    - Step 6: Verify that there are no bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs)
        that grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Step 4: Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Step 5: In the "Block public access (bucket settings)" section, ensure all options
        are enabled to block public access.
    - Step 6: Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Step 7: Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
