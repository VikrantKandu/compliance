    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access. Misconfigured buckets can lead to significant security
      incidents, including data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket is
      not publicly accessible.
    - Verify that block public access settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
