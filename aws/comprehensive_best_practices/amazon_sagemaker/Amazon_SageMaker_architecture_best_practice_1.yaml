    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and
      Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by requiring an additional
      authentication factor.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring
      a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access,
      especially if passwords are compromised.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
        for each user to verify MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA device is enabled and functioning correctly.
