    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private to prevent
      unauthorized access to the data stored within them. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private minimizes the risk of unauthorized access
      and data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive information,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets and check the access permissions. 4. Verify
      that each bucket does not allow public access by reviewing the bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is not compliant. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4.
      Adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
      5. Enable the "Block all public access" setting to prevent future changes that
      could expose the bucket.
