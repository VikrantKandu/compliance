    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and security vulnerabilities. Ensuring buckets are not
      publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select a bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block all public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 3: Click on the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Step 4: Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Step 5: Save changes to apply the new settings.
