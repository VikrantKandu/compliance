    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps ensure that instances are built with a secure
      and compliant baseline configuration, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and
      configuration errors. Unapproved AMIs may contain insecure configurations, outdated
      software, or malicious content.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each running instance, check the 'AMI ID' field.
    - Verify that the AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by your
      organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any publicly available
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running unapproved AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using an approved AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data to the new instance.
    - Terminate the instance running the unapproved AMI.
