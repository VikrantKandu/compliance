    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Check for any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any public policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Configure bucket policies to explicitly deny public access.
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket via the S3 console or AWS
      CLI.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
