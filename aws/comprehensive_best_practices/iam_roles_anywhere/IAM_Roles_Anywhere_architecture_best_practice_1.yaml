    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and pose a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible protects sensitive
      information and complies with data privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Consider using the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent any future public
      access configurations.
