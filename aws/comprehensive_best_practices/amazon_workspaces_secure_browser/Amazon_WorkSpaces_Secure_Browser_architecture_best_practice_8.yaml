    Title: Ensure AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, and
      operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. By enabling CloudTrail in
      all regions, you ensure that all activity is logged and monitored, even if resources
      are accidentally or intentionally created in new regions.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail in all regions helps detect unauthorized access
      and actions in your AWS account. Without it, there is a risk of missing critical
      security events, which could lead to undetected malicious activity or breaches.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
    - Ensure that a trail is created and enabled for all regions.
    - Verify that the trail is logging to an S3 bucket and that log file validation
      is enabled.
    Default Value: CloudTrail is not enabled by default in all regions.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the CloudTrail service.
    - Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to include all regions.
    - Ensure that the trail is configured to deliver logs to an S3 bucket with log
      file validation enabled.
