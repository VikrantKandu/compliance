    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to provide an additional layer of security beyond just a username
      and password. MFA helps protect user access by requiring a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose a user to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
