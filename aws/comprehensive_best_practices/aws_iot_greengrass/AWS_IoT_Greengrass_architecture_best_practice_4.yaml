    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure,
      potentially resulting in data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be exploited by unauthorized
      users to access sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private reduces
      the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is private.
