    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible by default helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        to verify the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
