    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to S3 buckets can lead
      to sensitive data being exposed to the internet, which can be exploited by malicious
      actors.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to data leakage, reputational damage, and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets in the account.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      there are no public permissions.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket that is publicly accessible, review and modify the bucket policy
      and ACL to remove public permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the account and individual buckets
      to prevent future misconfigurations.
