    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and bucket policy.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a policy allowing public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket ACLs do not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Modify the bucket ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    - Use the Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the
      account level.
