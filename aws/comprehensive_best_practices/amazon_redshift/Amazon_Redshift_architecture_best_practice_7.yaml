    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive information to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access permissions.
      Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) for public access settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket YOUR_BUCKET_NAME to
      verify ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure that public access is blocked
      at the account and bucket level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
