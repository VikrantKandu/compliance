    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users but are instead attached to groups or roles. This practice
      simplifies management and enhances security by ensuring consistent policy application.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex management
      and potential security risks due to inconsistent policy application. By attaching
      policies to groups or roles, it ensures that all users within a group or role
      have the same permissions, simplifying audits and reducing the risk of privilege
      escalation.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM users.
    - Check each user to ensure no policies are directly attached.
    - Verify that all necessary permissions are assigned through groups or roles.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies directly attached to users.
    - Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles.
    - Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles.
    - Add users to the appropriate groups or roles to grant them the necessary permissions.
