    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
      a second form of authentication, enhancing the security of AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials and reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to compromise through phishing or credential theft attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and review each user account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for each user by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to configure and enable MFA for the user.
