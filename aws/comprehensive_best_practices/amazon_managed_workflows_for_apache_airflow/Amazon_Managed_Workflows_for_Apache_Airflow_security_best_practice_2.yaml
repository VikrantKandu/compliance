  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk
      of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a bucket policy or ACL that allows public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to check for public access permissions.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy or
      ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket settings.
    - Consider enabling AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
