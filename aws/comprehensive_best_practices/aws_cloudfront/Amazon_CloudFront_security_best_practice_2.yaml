    Title: Enable AWS CloudTrail in all regions
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all regions to capture all API
      calls and store the log files in a centralized S3 bucket. This helps in monitoring,
      compliance, and security analysis.
    Rationale: Enabling CloudTrail ensures that all API activity within an AWS account
      is logged. This is crucial for auditing and forensic investigations. Without
      CloudTrail, identifying unauthorized access or changes becomes challenging,
      increasing the risk of security breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudTrail
      service. 3. Ensure there is at least one trail created and it is applied to
      all regions. 4. Verify that the trail is configured to log all management events.
      5. Check that the logs are being delivered to a secure S3 bucket.
    Default Value: By default, CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions.
    Remediation: 1. Open the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the CloudTrail service.
      3. Create a new trail or modify an existing trail to apply to all regions. 4.
      Ensure that the trail is configured to log all management events. 5. Specify
      a secure S3 bucket for log delivery. 6. Enable log file validation for integrity
      checks.
