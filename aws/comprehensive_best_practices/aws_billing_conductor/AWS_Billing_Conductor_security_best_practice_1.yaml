    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password but also a second form
      of verification. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to
      enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's credentials
      can easily access AWS services. MFA provides an additional layer of security
      by requiring a second factor, such as a code from a mobile app.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" to list all IAM users.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically
      verify MFA devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" to assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Follow the prompts to configure and enable MFA for the user.
