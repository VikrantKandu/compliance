    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps safeguard sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets is crucial for data protection.
      Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to unauthorized access,
      which can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the properties.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the properties section of the bucket.
    - Enable server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or Amazon
      S3-managed keys (SSE-S3).
