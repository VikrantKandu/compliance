    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets protects sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to security and compliance risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access policies
      or ACLs set.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      verify the bucket's ACL.
    - Check the bucket policy using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    - Ensure that both the ACL and bucket policy do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting on the bucket to prevent future public
      access configurations.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
