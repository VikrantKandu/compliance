    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to anyone
      on the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access settings at the
      account level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access at the account
      level.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
