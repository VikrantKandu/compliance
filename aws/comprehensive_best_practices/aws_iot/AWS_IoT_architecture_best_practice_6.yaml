    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Misconfigured buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance violations,
      and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and disable public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
