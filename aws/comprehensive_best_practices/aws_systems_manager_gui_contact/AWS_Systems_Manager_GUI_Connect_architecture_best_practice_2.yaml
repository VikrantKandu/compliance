    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk, as
      they allow anyone on the internet to access the data stored in them. This can
      lead to data leaks, unauthorized data manipulation, and potential legal and
      compliance issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions to ensure that no bucket is publicly accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for public access settings.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically list all S3 buckets and check their public
      access settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the S3 bucket policy.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is allowed.
    - Use AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access to all buckets
      and objects.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to maintain compliance.
