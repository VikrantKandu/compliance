    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
      Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data
      and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that should not be publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
