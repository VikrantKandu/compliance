    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized
      access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and non-compliance with data protection regulations. By
      ensuring that buckets are private, you minimize the risk of unauthorized data
      access.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets
      marked as 'Public'. 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the
      'Permissions' tab. 5. Verify that 'Block all public access' is turned on.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 4. Enable 'Block all public access' settings. 5. Review and remove any
      bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
