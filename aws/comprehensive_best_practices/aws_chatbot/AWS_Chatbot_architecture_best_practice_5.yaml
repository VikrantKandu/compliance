    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic.
      Using a custom security group with specific rules enhances security by limiting
      access to only necessary ports and IP addresses.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can expose instances to potential attacks. By using a custom security
      group, you can restrict access and reduce the attack surface, thereby improving
      the security posture of your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Step 5: Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group, which allows all traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify all instances using the default security group.
    - Step 2: Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules
        tailored to your application's needs.
    - Step 3: Associate the custom security group with the instances.
    - Step 4: Remove the default security group association from the instances.
