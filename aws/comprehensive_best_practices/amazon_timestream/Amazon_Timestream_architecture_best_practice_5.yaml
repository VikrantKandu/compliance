    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets have versioning enabled to
      protect against accidental data loss and to maintain data integrity.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets allows for the recovery of previous
      versions of objects, which is crucial in case of accidental deletions or overwrites.
      Without versioning, data loss could be permanent and could impact business operations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab.
    - Ensure that "Versioning" is set to "Enabled".
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have versioning disabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to enable versioning for.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Click on "Versioning" and select "Enable versioning".
    - Save the changes.
