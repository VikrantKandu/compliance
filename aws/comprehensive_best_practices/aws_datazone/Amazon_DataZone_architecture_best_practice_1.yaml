  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Restricting access to only authorized
      users mitigates this risk.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions. 4. Check the 'Block
      Public Access' settings for each bucket. 5. Ensure that the 'Block all public
      access' option is enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have 'Block all public access' enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
