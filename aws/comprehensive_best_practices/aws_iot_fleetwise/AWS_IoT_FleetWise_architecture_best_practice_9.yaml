    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets
      should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private
      mitigates the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the 'Block
      all public access' setting is enabled. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify that the bucket ACL does not
      grant public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure there are no bucket policies allowing public
      access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be public, go to the AWS Management Console.
      2. Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket. 3. Click on 'Permissions'
      and enable 'Block all public access'. 4. Review and adjust bucket policies and
      ACLs to remove any public access permissions. 5. Use the AWS CLI to update bucket
      policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
