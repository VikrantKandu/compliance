    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not public reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for public indicators.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and review the 'Block public access' settings.
    - Ensure that all public access settings are enabled to block public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access is blocked
      unless explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable all options under 'Block public access' to ensure no public access is
      allowed.
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
