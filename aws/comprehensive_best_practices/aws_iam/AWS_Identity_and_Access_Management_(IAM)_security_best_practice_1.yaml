    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to provide an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to
      provide a second form of authentication, adding an additional layer of protection
      against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is crucial as it significantly enhances
      security by requiring more than just a password to access the account. Without
      MFA, if the root account password is compromised, an attacker could gain full
      access to all resources in the AWS account, leading to potential data breaches
      and unauthorized modifications.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and verify
      that 'AccountMFAEnabled' is set to true.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to 'My Security Credentials'.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', click 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the setup by entering the authentication codes provided by the MFA device.
