    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and security. This practice helps in controlling
      inbound and outbound traffic to instances and provides an additional layer of
      security.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides enhanced security and
      control over network configurations. Instances outside a VPC do not have the
      same level of network isolation and are exposed to potential security risks.
      Utilizing a VPC allows for better management of security groups and network
      access control lists (ACLs).
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select the "Instances" menu.
    - Check the "VPC ID" column to ensure all instances have a VPC ID associated with
      them.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and verify
      that each instance has a VPC ID.
    Default Value: By default, instances launched in newer AWS accounts are within
      a default VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances not within a VPC.
    - Create a VPC if one does not exist.
    - Stop the instance, create an AMI, and launch a new instance within the VPC using
      the AMI.
    - Update DNS records and security groups as needed to ensure functionality and
      security.
