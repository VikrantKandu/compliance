    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: By preventing public access to S3 buckets, organizations can protect
      their data from unauthorized users and reduce the risk of data leaks. Public
      buckets can expose sensitive information, leading to compliance violations and
      reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
