    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private, ensuring
      that they are not publicly accessible unless explicitly intended. This involves
      setting the correct bucket policies and permissions.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes
      the risk of exposing data to unintended parties.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the bucket policy and permissions for each.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have a policy allowing public access or that
      the Block Public Access setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, and public access must be explicitly
      granted.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Re-evaluate permissions for any IAM users or roles that need access to ensure
      they are correctly configured.
