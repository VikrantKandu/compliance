    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible. Public
      access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential data
      breaches. It is crucial to restrict access to only those who need it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data leaks and security incidents. Restricting access minimizes the
      risk of unauthorized data exposure and enhances data security.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket. 4. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 5. Ensure that the "Block
      all public access" setting is enabled. 6. Verify that no bucket policies or
      ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      allowed.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the AWS S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly
      accessible. 3. Go to the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable the "Block all public
      access" option. 5. Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public
      access permissions.
