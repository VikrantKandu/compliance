    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent data
      breaches and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to potential security and compliance issues.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Test the bucket to ensure it is not publicly accessible.
