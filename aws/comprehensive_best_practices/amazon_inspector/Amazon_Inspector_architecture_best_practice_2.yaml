    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets should be
      restricted to maintain data privacy and security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access minimizes the risk
      of data exposure and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the Access column for each bucket.
    - Confirm that no bucket is marked as Public.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that the bucket ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and review the Block public access settings.
    - Enable Block all public access if not already enabled.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
