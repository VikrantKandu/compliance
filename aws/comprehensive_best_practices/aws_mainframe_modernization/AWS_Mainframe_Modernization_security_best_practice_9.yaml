    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data to
      unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list and check bucket policies for public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK to modify the bucket settings.
    - Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or individual
      buckets to prevent future public access configurations.
