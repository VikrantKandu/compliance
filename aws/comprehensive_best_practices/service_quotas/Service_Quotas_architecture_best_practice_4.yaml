    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data exposure,
      unauthorized access, and data breaches. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions of each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update any IAM policies or ACLs that may grant unintended public
      access.
