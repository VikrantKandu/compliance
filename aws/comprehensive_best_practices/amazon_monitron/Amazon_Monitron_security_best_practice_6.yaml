    Title: Enable Versioning on S3 Buckets
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that versioning is enabled on all S3 buckets to protect against
      accidental or malicious data deletion and overwriting.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps preserve, retrieve, and restore
      every version of every object stored in a bucket. This is crucial for data recovery
      in case of accidental deletions or overwriting, providing an additional layer
      of protection.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and verify that versioning is enabled under the "Properties"
      tab.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the status of versioning for each bucket.
    Default Value: Versioning is disabled by default on new S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket where versioning needs to be enabled.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and click on "Versioning".
    - Enable versioning and save the changes.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket
      <bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled to enable versioning
      programmatically.
