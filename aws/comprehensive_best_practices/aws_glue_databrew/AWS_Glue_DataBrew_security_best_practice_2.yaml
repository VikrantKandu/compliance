    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure
      and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data leaks and security breaches. Restricting access ensures
      that only authorized users can access the data, maintaining confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled, or review the
      bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured to be public.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save the changes and verify the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
