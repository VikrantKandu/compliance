    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive
      information stored in S3 from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data is
      automatically encrypted before being written to disk and decrypted when accessed.
      This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the properties.
    - Verify that the 'Default encryption' is enabled and configured to use either
      AWS-KMS or AES-256.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Default encryption', choose 'Enable' and select either AWS-KMS or AES-256.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption settings to the bucket.
