  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Ensure that no bucket has
      "Public" access status. 5. Verify that the bucket policy and access control
      lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
  - Remediation: 1. Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access. 2.
      Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to buckets and
      objects. 3. Regularly review bucket permissions and adjust them to ensure compliance
      with the organization's security policies.
