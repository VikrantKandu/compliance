    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an additional layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, enhancing account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and review the 'MFA' column for each user.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user and click 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign an
      MFA device.
