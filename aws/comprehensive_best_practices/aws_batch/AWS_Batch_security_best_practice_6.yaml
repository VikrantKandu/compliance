    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect
      data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be modified.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'Block Public Access'.
    - Enable all options to block public access and save the changes.
