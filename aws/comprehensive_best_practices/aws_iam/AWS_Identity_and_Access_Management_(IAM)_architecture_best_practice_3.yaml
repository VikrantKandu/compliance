    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates the risk
      of data leaks and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab and ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME to verify
      that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
