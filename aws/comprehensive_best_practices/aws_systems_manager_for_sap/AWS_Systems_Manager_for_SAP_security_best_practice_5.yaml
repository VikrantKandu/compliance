    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data from being exposed to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a policy that allows public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
