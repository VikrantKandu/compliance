    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Verify that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access, posing a significant security risk. Ensuring buckets are not public
      helps protect sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and access settings.
    - Ensure that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have public access settings enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to restrict public access to the bucket.
