    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are private protects sensitive data and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that public access settings are blocked.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs)
      for any public access configurations.
    - Verify that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and disable any public access settings.
    - Ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access permissions.
