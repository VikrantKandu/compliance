    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect sensitive information
      and maintain data privacy.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access permissions enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL and bucket policy.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update any bucket policies that allow public access to ensure they
      comply with security best practices.
