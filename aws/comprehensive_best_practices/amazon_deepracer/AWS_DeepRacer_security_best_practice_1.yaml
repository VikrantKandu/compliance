    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible protects
      sensitive data and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets.
    - Check the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) settings to ensure they
      do not allow public access.
    - Verify that the 'Block Public Access' settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket policy and ACL settings to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for all S3 buckets.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance.
