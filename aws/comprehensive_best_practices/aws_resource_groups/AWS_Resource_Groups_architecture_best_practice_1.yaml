  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private protects sensitive information
      and complies with data protection regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has a public access policy.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and check for
      public access configurations.
  - Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access configurations.
