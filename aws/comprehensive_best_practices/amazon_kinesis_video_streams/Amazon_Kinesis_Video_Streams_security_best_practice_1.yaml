    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Making S3 buckets publicly accessible can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure public access is restricted.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for any public permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
    - Save the changes to ensure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
