    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, typically
      a code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. If an IAM user's credentials are compromised, an attacker
      would still need the second form of authentication to gain access, thereby providing
      an additional layer of security.
    Audit: To verify compliance, list all IAM users and check if MFA is enabled for
      each user. This can be done using the AWS Management Console by navigating to
      the IAM dashboard, selecting users, and reviewing the security status for MFA.
      Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically check the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: If MFA is not enabled for an IAM user, enable it by navigating to
      the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management Console, selecting the user, and following
      the steps to assign an MFA device. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to associate
      an MFA device with the user.
