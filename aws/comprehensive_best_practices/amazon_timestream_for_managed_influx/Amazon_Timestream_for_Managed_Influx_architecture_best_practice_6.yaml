    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide not only a password but also a second form of
      authentication. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised accounts due to phishing
      attacks or password theft. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized actions within
      the AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Check the "Security credentials" tab for each user to confirm MFA is activated.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose "Users".
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA" and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
