    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data
      exposure and security breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data loss or leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions to ensure that "Block all public
      access" is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and ensure "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      they are restricted.
