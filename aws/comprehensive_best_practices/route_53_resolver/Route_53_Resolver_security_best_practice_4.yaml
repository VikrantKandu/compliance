    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using the latest Amazon
      Machine Image (AMI) to leverage the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been addressed in newer versions. Ensuring usage of the latest AMI helps maintain
      the security and stability of the instance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Check the AMI ID of each running instance.
    - Compare the AMI ID with the latest available AMI for the respective operating
      system.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with any AMI, not necessarily the latest.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using the latest AMI.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate workloads from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance after confirming successful migration.
