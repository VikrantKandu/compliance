  - Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are attached only to groups
      or roles, not directly to individual users. This best practice helps manage
      permissions at scale and reduces the risk of excessive permissions.
  - Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to overly permissive
      access and makes it difficult to manage permissions. By attaching policies to
      groups or roles, you can more easily control and audit access permissions, reducing
      the risk of unauthorized access.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select a user and check the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Verify that no policies are directly attached to the user. 6. Repeat
      for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify users with directly attached policies. 2. Create a group
      or role with the necessary policies. 3. Attach the group or role to the user
      instead of attaching policies directly. 4. Remove the directly attached policies
      from the user.
