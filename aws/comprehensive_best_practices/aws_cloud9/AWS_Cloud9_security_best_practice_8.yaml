    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for maintaining data
      security and privacy. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Ensure that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled. 5. Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 console. 2. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
      3. Click on 'Permissions' and then 'Block public access'. 4. Enable 'Block all
      public access' and save changes. 5. Review and modify bucket policies to restrict
      public access where necessary.
