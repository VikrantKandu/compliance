    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is critical to prevent unauthorized access
      and data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to
      the internet, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no buckets have public access enabled under the "Block public access"
      settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users may change this setting.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Save the changes to apply the new settings.
