    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. It is important to
      restrict public access to protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      access, and data leaks. By ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible,
      organizations can mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block public access" settings.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
        and verify that the ACL does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" under "Block public access (bucket settings)".
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
