    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect data privacy and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the Block public access settings and ensure that all options are enabled.
    - Review the bucket policy and ensure there are no statements allowing public
      access.
    - Verify that there are no public access control lists (ACLs) granting public
      read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable Block all public access in the S3 bucket settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies that allow public access.
    - Update ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
