    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check to ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can lead to
      data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive information to
      the internet, leading to potential data leaks, unauthorized access, and compliance
      issues. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data
      breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the permissions and bucket policy. 4. Verify that
      the bucket does not have a policy allowing public access. 5. Ensure the 'Block
      all public access' setting is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. In the AWS Management Console, go to the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable
      'Block all public access' if it is not already enabled. 5. Review and update
      the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access. 6. Save
      the changes to apply the updated settings.
