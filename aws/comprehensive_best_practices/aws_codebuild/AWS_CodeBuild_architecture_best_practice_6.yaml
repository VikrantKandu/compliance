    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS accounts to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identity before gaining access to an
      account, significantly enhancing the security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of AWS accounts by requiring users
      to provide additional verification beyond just a password. This reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access to accounts, even if a password is compromised.
      Failure to enable MFA can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users and aws iam get-user
        to check for MFA device associations.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for AWS accounts.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, select "Security credentials" and click on "Manage MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to set up and enable MFA for each user.
