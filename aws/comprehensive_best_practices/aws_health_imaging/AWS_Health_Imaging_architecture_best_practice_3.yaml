    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets are by default private, but
      configurations can change, potentially exposing data.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches,
      unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - Verify that each bucket's access is set to private and does not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI to list all buckets and check their ACLs and bucket
      policies for public access permissions.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Under the Permissions tab, adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public
      access.
    - Use the Block Public Access settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Confirm the changes to ensure the bucket is now private.
