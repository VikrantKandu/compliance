    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the buckets.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of accidental data leaks.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 dashboard.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket
      does not have public access enabled. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to review the ACL settings. 5. Use the AWS CLI command
      aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy
      and ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 dashboard in the AWS Management Console. 2.
      Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on the Permissions tab.
      4. Adjust the bucket ACL to remove any public access. 5. Update the bucket policy
      to restrict public access and ensure only authorized users have permissions.
