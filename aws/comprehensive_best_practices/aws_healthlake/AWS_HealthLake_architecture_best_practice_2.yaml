    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security. MFA
      provides an additional layer of security by requiring not only a password and
      username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a physical
      device or token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker can easily gain access. MFA helps protect against such scenarios
      by adding an extra layer of security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users to retrieve the list
        of users and check their MFA status with aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
        <username>.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
