    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can pose a security risk. It is recommended to create custom security groups
      with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored to the application's needs.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unauthorized access to
      EC2 instances, as it allows unrestricted traffic. This can expose instances
      to potential attacks and data breaches. Custom security groups help enforce
      the principle of least privilege and ensure that only necessary traffic is allowed.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Step 5: Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Step 2: Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Step 3: Detach the default security group from the instances.
    - Step 4: Attach the newly created security group to the instances.
