    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any indication
      of public access.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
