    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data
      exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data access. Ensuring that buckets
      are not publicly accessible helps protect sensitive data and maintain confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket's permissions to ensure it
      does not grant public access. 5. Use the AWS CLI or SDK to run the command aws
      s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> and verify that the ACL does not
      allow public access. 6. Run aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to ensure the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, review the bucket's
      permissions and policies. 2. Remove any public access granted through bucket
      ACLs or bucket policies. 3. Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public
      access. 4. Use AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access
      at the account level.
