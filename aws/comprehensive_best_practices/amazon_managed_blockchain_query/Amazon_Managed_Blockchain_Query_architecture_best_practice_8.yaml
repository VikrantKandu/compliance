    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and
      potential breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users. Restricting public access reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are not publicly accessible by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
