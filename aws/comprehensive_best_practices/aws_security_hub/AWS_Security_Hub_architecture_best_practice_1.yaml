    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps prevent data breaches
      and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to accidental data exposure or malicious activities.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions. 4. Check the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL) for each bucket to ensure no public access
      is granted. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket
      policy to remove public access. 2. Update the ACL to ensure that only authorized
      users and services have access to the bucket. 3. Enable block public access
      settings for the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
