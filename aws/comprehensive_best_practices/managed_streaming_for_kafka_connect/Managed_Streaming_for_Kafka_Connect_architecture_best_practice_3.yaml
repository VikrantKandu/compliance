    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to the AWS Management Console by requiring users to provide a second form of
      authentication. This is crucial for protecting sensitive resources and data.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of compromised credentials
      and unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is compromised, an attacker can easily gain access to the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by looking for an MFA device in the 'Security
      credentials' tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Users'.
    - Select a user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under the 'Assigned MFA device' section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
