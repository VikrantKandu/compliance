    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access to ensure
      sensitive data is not exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Enable "Block all public access" for each S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to grant access to specific users or roles instead of public
      access.
