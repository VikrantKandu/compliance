    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Ensuring that buckets
      are private by default helps protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block public
      access" settings to ensure they are enabled. 5. Verify that there are no bucket
      policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Click on the "Permissions" tab. 4. Enable "Block all
      public access" to prevent public access. 5. Review and modify any bucket policies
      or ACLs to remove public access permissions.
