    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, an attacker who gains access to a user's password
      can access AWS resources. MFA adds a second authentication factor, making unauthorized
      access more difficult.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      MFA devices and verify their association with users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
    - Ensure that all IAM users have MFA enabled.
