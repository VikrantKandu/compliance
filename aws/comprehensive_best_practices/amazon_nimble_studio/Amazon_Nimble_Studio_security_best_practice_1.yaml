    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as unauthorized
      users can access, modify, or delete data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps
      protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that the bucket
      policy and ACL do not allow public access. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify the ACL. 5. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket_name> to review the bucket
      policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public ACLs from the bucket. 2. Update the bucket policy
      to restrict public access. 3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent
      future public access configurations.
