    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leakage and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data from being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL)
      to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to programmatically verify the bucket's ACL and policy settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Block all public access by configuring the bucket settings.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket policies and ACLs to remove public access.
