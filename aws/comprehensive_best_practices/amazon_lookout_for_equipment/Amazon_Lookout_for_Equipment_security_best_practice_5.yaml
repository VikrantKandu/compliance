    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings for the bucket.
