    Title: Ensure S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps secure sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Rationale: Server-side encryption protects data at rest by encrypting the data
      stored in S3 buckets. Without encryption, sensitive data could be exposed if
      unauthorized access occurs. This check helps mitigate risks such as data breaches
      and non-compliance with regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and check the 'Properties' tab. 4. Verify that 'Default
      encryption' is enabled under the 'Server-side encryption' section. 5. Alternatively,
      use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Click on the 'Properties' tab. 4. Under 'Server-side
      encryption', select 'Edit'. 5. Choose an encryption option such as AES-256 or
      AWS-KMS. 6. Save changes to enable server-side encryption for the bucket.
