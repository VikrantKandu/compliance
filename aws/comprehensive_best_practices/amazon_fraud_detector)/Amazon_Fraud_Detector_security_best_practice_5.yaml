    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to present a second form of authentication, typically a temporary
      code from a mobile device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the account. MFA helps mitigate this risk
      by requiring an additional authentication factor.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user and check if
      'MFA' is enabled on the 'Security credentials' tab. 5. Alternatively, use the
      AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to list users without MFA
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. On the 'Security credentials' tab, choose 'Manage'
      under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)'. 6. Follow the prompts to enable a
      virtual or hardware MFA device for the user.
