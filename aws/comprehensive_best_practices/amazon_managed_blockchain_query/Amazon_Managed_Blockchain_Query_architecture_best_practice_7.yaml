    Title: Ensure AWS CloudFront distributions are using HTTPS
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS CloudFront distributions are configured
      to use HTTPS for secure data transmission. HTTPS encrypts data in transit, protecting
      it from interception and tampering.
    Rationale: Using HTTPS ensures data confidentiality and integrity between the
      user and CloudFront. Without HTTPS, data is vulnerable to interception and man-in-the-middle
      attacks, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Review each CloudFront distribution.
    - Check that the 'Viewer Protocol Policy' is set to 'Redirect HTTP to HTTPS' or
      'HTTPS Only'.
    Default Value: By default, CloudFront distributions may allow both HTTP and HTTPS.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
    - Select the distribution to update.
    - Choose the 'Behaviors' tab.
    - Edit the behavior settings.
    - Set 'Viewer Protocol Policy' to 'Redirect HTTP to HTTPS' or 'HTTPS Only'.
    - Save changes and deploy the updated configuration.
