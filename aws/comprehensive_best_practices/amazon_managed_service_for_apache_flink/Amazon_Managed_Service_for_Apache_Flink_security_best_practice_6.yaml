    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain a consistent security baseline across
      the environment.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps ensure that instances are configured according
      to organizational security policies and include necessary security patches and
      configurations. Non-compliance could lead to vulnerabilities and security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: List all running EC2 instances in the account.
    - Step 2: Retrieve the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Step 3: Verify that each AMI ID is listed in the approved AMI list maintained
        by the organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      AMI unless restrictions are in place.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify any EC2 instances using non-approved AMIs.
    - Step 2: Stop the instance and create a snapshot of the instance's volumes.
    - Step 3: Launch a new instance using an approved AMI and attach the snapshot
        volumes.
    - Step 4: Verify the configuration and data integrity of the new instance before
        terminating the old instance.
