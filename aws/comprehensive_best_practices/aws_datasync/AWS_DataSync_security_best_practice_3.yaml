    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      users from accessing sensitive data. Public buckets can expose confidential
      information and lead to compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not allow public access by verifying that the 'Block
      Public Access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets have public access blocked unless explicitly
      allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and review the 'Block Public Access' settings.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public permissions.
