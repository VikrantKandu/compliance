    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to data exposure. Public access should be restricted to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Allowing public access to S3 buckets can result in data breaches and
      unauthorized data exposure. Restricting public access helps protect sensitive
      information and complies with data privacy regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each S3 bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Step 4: Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant
        public access.
    - Step 5: Use the "Block Public Access" feature to confirm that public access
        is blocked for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Review the bucket policy and ACL, and remove any statements that allow
        public access.
    - Step 5: Enable the "Block Public Access" feature for the bucket to prevent future
        public access.
