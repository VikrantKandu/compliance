    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS accounts. This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all IAM
      users to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      by requiring an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, accounts are
      more vulnerable to credential theft and unauthorized access.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users". 4. For each user, check the
      "MFA" column to verify if "Enabled" is displayed. 5. Alternatively, use the
      AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name
      <username> to check for MFA devices associated with each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Click on the username
      for which you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the "Security credentials" tab.
      6. In the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage". 7. Follow the prompts
      to assign an MFA device to the user. 8. Repeat the process for all users without
      MFA enabled.
