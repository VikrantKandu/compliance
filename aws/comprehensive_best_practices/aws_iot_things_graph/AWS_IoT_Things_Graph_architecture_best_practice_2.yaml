    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption. Encryption at rest protects data by converting it into
      a form that is unreadable to anyone who does not have the key to decrypt it.
    Rationale: Encrypting S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements. If S3 buckets are
      not encrypted, data may be exposed to potential security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Default encryption" section under "Properties".
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Under "Default encryption", choose "Enable" and select the desired encryption
      method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save the changes.
