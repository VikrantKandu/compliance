    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect data from unauthorized
      access and potential breaches.
    Rationale: Enabling encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data is protected from
      unauthorized access. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is vulnerable to
      unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify if server-side encryption is
      enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Under the properties section, enable server-side encryption with the desired
      encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted.
