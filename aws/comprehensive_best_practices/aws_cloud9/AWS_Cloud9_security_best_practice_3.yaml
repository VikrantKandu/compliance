    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, restricting access to only authorized users. Publicly accessible S3
      buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets are private. Ensuring buckets remain private
      prevents unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public buckets can
      expose sensitive data to the internet, posing significant security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public
      access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" option.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
