    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce the
      risk of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks. Public buckets can
      be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access permissions.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public access" settings to ensure that public access
      is blocked.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify that ACL settings do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Under "Block public access", ensure all options are checked to block public
      access.
    - Save changes to apply the new settings.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access permissions
      are granted.
