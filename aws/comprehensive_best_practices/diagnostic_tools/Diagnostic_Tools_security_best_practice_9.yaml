    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of username and password. It is crucial to enable MFA for all IAM users
      to prevent unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used
      to access AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker can gain access to the account and potentially cause data breaches
      or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA enabled" column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify the MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - Click on a user name.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, select "Manage MFA device".
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
    - Repeat the process for each IAM user without MFA enabled.
