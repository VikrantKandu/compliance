    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict public
      access to prevent sensitive information from being available to the public.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates the risk of data exposure and enhances the security posture of your
      AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab to ensure that the bucket policy
      does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are configured to block all public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket's ACL to ensure it does not grant public access.
