    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public access to
      S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. By default, S3 buckets should be private to ensure data is only
      accessible by authorized users. Failing to secure S3 buckets can result in data
      leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
