    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. It requires users to provide a unique authentication
      code from their MFA device when they access AWS websites or services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access. If MFA is not enabled, a compromised password could lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to use MFA.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Click on "Users" in the navigation pane.
    - Select a user and click on "Security credentials".
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", click "Manage" and follow the prompts to enable
      MFA for the user.
