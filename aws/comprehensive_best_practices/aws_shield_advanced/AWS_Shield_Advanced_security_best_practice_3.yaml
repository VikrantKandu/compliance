    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code
      sent to a mobile device, in addition to the password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
      Without MFA, if an IAM user's password is compromised, an attacker could gain
      full access to AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces this risk by requiring
      a second authentication factor.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security Credentials tab and click on Manage MFA Device.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
