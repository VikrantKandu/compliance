    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible. S3 buckets should be configured to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of exposing data to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and check the permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Review and edit the bucket policy and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable bucket versioning and server-side encryption for added security.
