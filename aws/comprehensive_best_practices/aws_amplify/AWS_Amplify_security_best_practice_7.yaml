    Title: Ensure VPC Flow Logs are enabled for all VPCs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and
      from network interfaces in a VPC. Enabling VPC Flow Logs can help with monitoring,
      troubleshooting, and security analysis.
    Rationale: Enabling VPC Flow Logs provides visibility into network traffic, which
      is crucial for identifying and responding to anomalous or malicious activity.
      Without flow logs, there is limited visibility into the network traffic, increasing
      the risk of undetected security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the VPC dashboard.
    - Select the VPCs from the left-hand menu.
    - For each VPC, check if Flow Logs are enabled by reviewing the Flow Logs tab.
    - Verify that the logs are being sent to a centralized logging solution, such
      as CloudWatch Logs or an S3 bucket.
    Default Value: By default, VPC Flow Logs are not enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the VPC dashboard.
    - Select the VPC where Flow Logs need to be enabled.
    - Click on the Flow Logs tab and choose Create Flow Log.
    - Configure the flow log settings, ensuring that the logs are sent to a secure
      location like CloudWatch Logs or an S3 bucket.
    - Save the changes to enable the flow logs for the selected VPC.
