    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users with console access to enhance security by requiring an additional
      authentication factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to
      provide a second form of authentication. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access in the event of a compromised password.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the Security credentials tab and click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
