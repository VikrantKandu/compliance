    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and result in data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets are vulnerable to data leaks, which can lead to compliance violations
      and reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled. 4. Check the bucket policy and access control lists (ACLs) to verify
      no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you want to secure. 4. Enable 'Block all public access'
      in the permissions settings. 5. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACLs
      to remove any public access permissions.
