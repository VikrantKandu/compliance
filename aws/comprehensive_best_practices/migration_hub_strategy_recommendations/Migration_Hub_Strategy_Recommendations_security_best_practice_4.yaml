    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to
      gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      prevent unauthorized access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials
      could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. For each user, check if MFA is
      enabled under the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Verify that all users have
      an MFA device assigned.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Under the "Security credentials" tab, choose
      "Manage MFA device". 6. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
