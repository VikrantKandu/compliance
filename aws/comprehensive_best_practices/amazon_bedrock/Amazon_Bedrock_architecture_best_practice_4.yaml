    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data access. Public access can expose sensitive data
      to anyone on the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Implementing this check helps maintain data
      confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      and bucket level.
    - Regularly review and update access policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
