    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data breaches, and non-compliance with data protection regulations. Ensuring
      buckets are not public reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the permissions of each S3 bucket. 4. Ensure that there are no public
      access permissions set for the buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Remove any public access permissions. 6. Apply bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) that restrict access to authorized users only.
