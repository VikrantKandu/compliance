    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that a strong password policy is enforced for
      IAM users. A robust password policy helps prevent unauthorized access by requiring
      users to create strong passwords.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without a strong password policy, accounts are vulnerable
      to brute force attacks and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured with strong requirements
      such as minimum length, requiring numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Enable the password policy and set requirements for minimum length, numbers,
      symbols, and uppercase letters.
    - Save changes to enforce the new password policy.
