  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security
      for your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional verification
      beyond just a password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect against
      unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of compromised credentials. Without MFA,
      if a password is stolen or guessed, an attacker could gain unauthorized access
      to your AWS resources. MFA requires an additional verification factor, making
      it significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select each user to verify if
      MFA is enabled. 5. Check the 'Security credentials' tab for the status of MFA.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      service. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose 'Security credentials' and then 'Manage MFA
      device'. 6. Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for
      the user.
