    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be launched in the default VPC to ensure
      a more controlled and secure network environment. Using custom VPCs allows for
      better network isolation and security configurations.
    Rationale: Using the default VPC can lead to less secure configurations as it
      may not be tailored to specific security requirements. Custom VPCs provide greater
      control over network settings and security.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Step 3: Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Step 4: Check the 'VPC ID' column for each instance.
    - Step 5: Verify that the 'VPC ID' does not match the default VPC ID for the region.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are launched in the default VPC.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Identify instances running in the default VPC.
    - Step 2: Plan a migration to a custom VPC with appropriate security configurations.
    - Step 3: Create a new VPC with the necessary subnets, route tables, and security
        groups.
    - Step 4: Stop the instance and create an AMI.
    - Step 5: Launch a new instance from the AMI in the custom VPC.
    - Step 6: Verify the configuration and functionality in the new VPC.
    - Step 7: Terminate the instance in the default VPC once migration is confirmed
        successful.
