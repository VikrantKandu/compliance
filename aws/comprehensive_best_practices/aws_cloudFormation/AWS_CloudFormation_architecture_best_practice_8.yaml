    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. This practice reduces the risk of unintended access and potential security
      breaches.
    Rationale: Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can expose instances to unnecessary risks. By not using the default security
      group, you can enforce more granular access control, minimizing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances are associated with the default security
      group unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the instances from the default security group.
