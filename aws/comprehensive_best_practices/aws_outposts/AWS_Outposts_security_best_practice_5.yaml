    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure, which can
      be a significant security risk. It is essential to configure S3 bucket permissions
      correctly to prevent unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private mitigates the
      risk of data exposure and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings and ensure that all public access is
      blocked.
    - Review the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
