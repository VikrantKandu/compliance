    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide a second form of verification
      in addition to their password. This helps protect against unauthorized access
      in case of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, a compromised password can lead to unauthorized
      access to sensitive data and services, potentially resulting in data breaches
      and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each IAM user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is
      enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Click on the specific user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage' under the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) section and follow
      the prompts to enable MFA.
