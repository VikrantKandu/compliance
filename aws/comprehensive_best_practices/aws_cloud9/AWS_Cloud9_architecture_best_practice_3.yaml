    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a password, requiring users to provide a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances the security of user accounts by
      requiring additional verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, compromised passwords can lead to unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user to whom you want to add MFA.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, click on "Assign MFA device."
    - Follow the prompts to select and configure an MFA device for the user.
