    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should
      not be publicly accessible unless explicitly required and justified.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Ensuring buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of exposing
      sensitive information to the public Internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that the "Block all public access"
      setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify bucket ACLs are not granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
    - Review and update any bucket policies or ACLs that might allow public access.
