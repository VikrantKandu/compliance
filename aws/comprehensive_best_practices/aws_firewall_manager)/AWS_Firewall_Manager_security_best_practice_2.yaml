  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access. Misconfigured bucket permissions are a common cause
      of data leaks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and ensure that no public access
      is allowed. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to review bucket ACLs. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to review bucket policies. 6. Verify that the block public
      access settings are enabled for each bucket.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the Permissions tab. 4. Edit
      the Block Public Access settings and enable all options. 5. Review and remove
      any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access. 6. Save the changes to
      ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
