    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have default encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling encryption helps protect your data
      from unauthorized access by ensuring that objects are encrypted when stored
      in S3.
    Rationale: Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of unauthorized access to
      sensitive information. If encryption is not enabled, data stored in S3 buckets
      may be vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to inspect.
    - Go to the Properties tab and check the "Default encryption" section.
    - Verify that server-side encryption is enabled with either Amazon S3-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the Properties tab.
    - Under the "Default encryption" section, select "Edit."
    - Enable server-side encryption with either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to the bucket.
