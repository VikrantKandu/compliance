    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized
      data access, data leaks, and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3 buckets
      are private by default helps mitigate these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets marked
      as 'Public'.
    - For each bucket, click on the bucket name and go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
