    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk, as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This may lead to data leaks,
      compliance violations, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that there are no 'Everyone' or 'Authenticated Users' permissions that
      grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to block public access at the account
      or bucket level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and remove
      any public access permissions.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance.
