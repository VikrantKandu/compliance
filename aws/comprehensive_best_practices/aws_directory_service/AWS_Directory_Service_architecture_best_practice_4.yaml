    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a security risk as they can be
      accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to unauthorized data access,
      data leakage, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Check the 'Block public access' settings to ensure that the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not accessible to the public.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' to ensure the bucket is not accessible to the
      public.
