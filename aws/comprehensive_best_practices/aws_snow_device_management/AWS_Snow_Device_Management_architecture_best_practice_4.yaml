    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      password policy is enabled and configured according to best practices. A strong
      password policy helps protect against unauthorized access by enforcing password
      complexity and expiration.
    Rationale: Implementing a strong password policy reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without a robust password policy, user accounts are more susceptible
      to brute force attacks and unauthorized access, potentially leading to data
      breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select "Account settings."
    - Verify that a password policy is enabled and configured with the following minimum settings:
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
      - Minimum password length of 8 characters.
      - Password expiration period of 90 days or less.
    Default Value: By default, AWS IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left pane, select "Account settings."
    - Enable and configure a password policy with the recommended settings.
    - Save the changes to enforce the new password policy.
