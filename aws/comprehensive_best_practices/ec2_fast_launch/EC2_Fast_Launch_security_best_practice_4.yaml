    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance the security of user accounts. MFA adds an additional layer
      of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, which
      helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an
      attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA mitigates this
      risk by requiring an additional verification step.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, AWS IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage MFA device" and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
