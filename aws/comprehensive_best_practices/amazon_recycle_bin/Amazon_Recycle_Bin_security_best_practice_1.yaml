    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private prevents unauthorized access to the data
      stored in them. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and security
      incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the permissions of each bucket to ensure that they are not set to public.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings for each bucket.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy for public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access settings.
    - Update the bucket permissions to restrict access to only authorized users and
      roles.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
