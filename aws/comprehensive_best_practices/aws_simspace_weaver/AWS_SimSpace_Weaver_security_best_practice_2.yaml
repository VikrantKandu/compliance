    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security by requiring
      a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to user accounts.
      Without MFA, compromised credentials could result in unauthorized access to
      AWS resources, leading to potential data breaches or misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check each IAM user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to verify MFA devices for each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select the user.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
