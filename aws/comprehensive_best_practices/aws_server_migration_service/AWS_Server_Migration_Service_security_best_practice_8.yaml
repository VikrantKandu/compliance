    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched with the latest
      Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to include the latest security patches and updates.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been patched in newer versions. Ensuring the use of the latest AMI helps in
      maintaining security and stability.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each running instance.
    - Compare the AMI IDs with the latest available AMIs in the AWS Marketplace or
      your custom AMIs.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless specified
      during launch.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate workloads from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance once migration is complete.
