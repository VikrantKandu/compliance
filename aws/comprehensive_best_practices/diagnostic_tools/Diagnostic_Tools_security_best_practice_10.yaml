    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets have Versioning Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have versioning enabled
      to protect against accidental data loss or overwrites by maintaining previous
      versions of objects.
    Rationale: Enabling versioning on S3 buckets helps protect against unintended
      overwrites and deletions. If versioning is not enabled, accidental deletions
      or overwrites can lead to permanent data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the Properties tab.
    - Verify that the Versioning status is set to Enabled.
    Default Value: By default, versioning is not enabled on S3 buckets.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that does not have versioning enabled.
    - Go to the Properties tab.
    - Enable versioning by clicking on the Edit button and selecting 'Enable'.
