    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a password,
      making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is crucial because this account has
      unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. If the root account
      is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches
      or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the security status to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam get-account-summary and check
      the AccountMFAEnabled value.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Under the security status, click on "Activate MFA on your root account".
    - Follow the prompts to select a virtual or hardware MFA device and complete the
      setup process.
