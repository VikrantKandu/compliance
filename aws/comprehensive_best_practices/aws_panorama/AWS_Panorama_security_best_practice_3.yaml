    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by attackers to gain access to confidential information or
      to distribute malicious content.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure
      no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access".
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that grant
      public access.
    - Re-evaluate the necessity of any public access requirements and implement them
      securely using IAM roles or policies.
