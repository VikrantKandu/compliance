    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group to enhance security by limiting unnecessary access.
    Rationale: Using the default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can expose instances to potential threats. Ensuring instances are associated
      with custom security groups with specific rules reduces the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific rules tailored to the instance's needs.
    - Disassociate the instance from the default security group.
    - Associate the instance with the newly created security group.
