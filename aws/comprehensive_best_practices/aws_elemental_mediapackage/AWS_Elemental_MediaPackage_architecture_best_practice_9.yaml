    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring buckets are private, you mitigate
      the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions tab for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the bucket's ACLs to ensure there are no public read or write permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to programmatically check the bucket policy status.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Restrict bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Utilize AWS IAM policies to grant access only to specific users or roles.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
