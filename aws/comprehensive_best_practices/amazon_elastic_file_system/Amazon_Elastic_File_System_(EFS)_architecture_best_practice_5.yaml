    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to potential security risks,
      as it allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default. This increases the
      attack surface and may lead to unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the EC2 instances.
    - Remove the association of the default security group from the instances.
