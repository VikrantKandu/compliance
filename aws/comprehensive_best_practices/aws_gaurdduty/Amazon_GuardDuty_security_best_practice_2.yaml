    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
      MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password, making
      it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS
      accounts. Without MFA, if a password is compromised, the account is vulnerable.
      MFA mitigates this risk by requiring a second form of authentication, thus enhancing
      security.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA'
      column to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command
      aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'. 4. Select the user for
      whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In
      the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the instructions
      to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
