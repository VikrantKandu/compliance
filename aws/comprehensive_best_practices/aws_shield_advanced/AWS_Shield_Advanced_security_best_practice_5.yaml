    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that the IAM password policy is enabled and configured to
      enforce strong password requirements. This includes setting a minimum password
      length, requiring specific character types, and enforcing password expiration.
    Rationale: A strong password policy helps protect AWS resources from unauthorized
      access by ensuring that user passwords are difficult to guess or crack. Without
      a strong password policy, accounts are more vulnerable to brute force attacks
      and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Verify the password policy settings to ensure they meet the organization's security
      requirements.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Account settings'.
    - Configure the password policy to meet the organization's security requirements,
      including setting a minimum password length, requiring specific character types,
      and enabling password expiration.
