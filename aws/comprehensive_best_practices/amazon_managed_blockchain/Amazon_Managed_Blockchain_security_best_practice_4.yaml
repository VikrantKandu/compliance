    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to sensitive data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not publicly accessible mitigates the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and identify any with public access permissions.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and ACL settings to ensure they do
      not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket with public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access permissions.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to prevent future public access configurations.
