    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest generation instance types
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are running on the latest
      generation instance types. Using the latest generation provides better performance,
      security enhancements, and cost efficiency.
    Rationale: Latest generation instances offer improved performance, enhanced security
      features, and often better cost efficiency compared to older generations. Not
      using the latest generation can lead to suboptimal performance and higher costs.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left navigation pane. 4. Review the instance types
      of all running instances and verify if they are using the latest generation.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may not be using the latest generation by default.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances not using the latest generation instance types.
      2. Plan and execute a migration to newer instance types, ensuring compatibility
      with your workloads. 3. Update any relevant scripts or infrastructure as code
      templates to use the latest generation instance types.
