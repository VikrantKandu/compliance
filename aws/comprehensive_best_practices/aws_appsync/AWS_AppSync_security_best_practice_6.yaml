    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access
      Management (IAM) users. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a time-based one-time
      password (TOTP) in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access,
      particularly if a password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to phishing attacks and brute force attempts.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Click on the username for which you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
