    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      should be restricted unless explicitly required for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to exposure of confidential information and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Confirm that the Block Public Access settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Save the changes to apply the new permissions.
