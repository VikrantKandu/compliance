    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private to protect data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data to the internet.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data access,
      and data leaks. Ensuring buckets are private is crucial for maintaining data
      confidentiality and compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the list of S3 buckets and identify any buckets marked as public.
    - Step 4: Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no
        public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: For any public bucket, navigate to the bucket's permissions section
        in the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Step 3: Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
        configurations.
    - Step 4: Regularly review bucket configurations to ensure compliance with this
        best practice.
