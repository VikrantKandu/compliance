    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access, enhancing the security of the
      AWS environment.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to password
      theft and unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and other
      security incidents.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> for each user to check for MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Click on a user and go to the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Click 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
    - Repeat the process for each user.
