  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a username and password by requiring a second form of verification.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts, even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, an attacker
      with stolen credentials can potentially gain full access to your AWS resources.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the 'MFA' column
      to see if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam
      list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically retrieve and verify
      MFA status for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the
      'Multi-factor authentication' section, choose 'Assign MFA device'. 7. Follow
      the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
