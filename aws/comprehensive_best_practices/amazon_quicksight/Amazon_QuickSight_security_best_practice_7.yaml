    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Configured with Server-Side Encryption
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption
      helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance
      with data protection standards.
    Rationale: Without server-side encryption, data stored in S3 buckets may be vulnerable
      to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches or non-compliance
      with regulatory requirements. Encrypting data at rest helps ensure data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Properties" tab.
    - Ensure that "Default encryption" is enabled and configured with either AES-256
      or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs encryption.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and click "Edit" in the "Default encryption" section.
    - Choose "Enable" and select either AES-256 or AWS-KMS for encryption.
    - Save the changes to apply server-side encryption to the bucket.
