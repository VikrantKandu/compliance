    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access. If a user's credentials are compromised, MFA provides an additional
      layer of security, protecting sensitive resources and data from unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - For each user, check the Security Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Under Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), choose Manage.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
