    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access should be restricted
      unless explicitly required for business purposes.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Restricting public access helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure no public access
      permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Enable block public access settings for the bucket.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
