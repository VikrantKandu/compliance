    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group to ensure that proper access control measures are in place. Default security
      groups may allow unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic, which can pose security
      risks.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to unintended network exposure
      due to permissive inbound and outbound rules. By not using default security
      groups, you can enforce stricter access control policies and reduce the risk
      of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the navigation pane.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that the security group is not the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be launched with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with the necessary inbound and outbound rules.
    - Associate the new security group with the instances.
    - Remove the default security group association.
