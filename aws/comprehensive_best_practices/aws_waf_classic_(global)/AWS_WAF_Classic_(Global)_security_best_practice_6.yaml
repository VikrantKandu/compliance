  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Public buckets can lead to data leaks, compliance violations,
      and potential financial and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the permissions. 4. Check the "Block Public
      Access" settings to ensure that no public access is allowed. 5. Verify that
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. 2. Select
      the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Click on "Block Public Access" and
      ensure all options are enabled. 4. Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs
      to remove any public access permissions. 5. Save changes to enforce the updated
      settings.
