    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to potential
      unauthorized access since it allows unrestricted traffic. Custom security groups
      should be created to restrict access based on specific needs and least privilege
      principles.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance's requirements.
    - Disassociate the default security group from the instance.
    - Associate the new custom security group with the instance.
