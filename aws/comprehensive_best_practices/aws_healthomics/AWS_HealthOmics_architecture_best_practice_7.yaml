    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to enhance security. MFA adds an additional layer of protection
      on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account is critical as it helps prevent unauthorized
      access to the account, which could lead to data breaches or unauthorized changes
      to configurations. Without MFA, the root account is more vulnerable to phishing
      attacks and password compromises.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the root account.
    - Check if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: By default, AWS accounts do not have MFA enabled on the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, choose Users.
    - Select the root account.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA by configuring either a virtual MFA device
      or a hardware MFA device.
