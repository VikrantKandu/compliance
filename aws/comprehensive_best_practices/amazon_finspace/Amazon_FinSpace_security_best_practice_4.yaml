    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are configured to be private.
      Public access should be restricted to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the bucket ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> for any public access configurations.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can modify this setting.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and ACL if necessary.
