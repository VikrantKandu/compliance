    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs helps ensure that instances are launched with a
      known configuration that adheres to security and compliance requirements. Non-approved
      AMIs may contain vulnerabilities or unauthorized software.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the left panel.
    - Review the AMI ID for each instance and verify it against the list of approved
      AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      or custom AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Terminate non-compliant instances or create new instances using approved AMIs.
    - Update policies to restrict the use of non-approved AMIs.
