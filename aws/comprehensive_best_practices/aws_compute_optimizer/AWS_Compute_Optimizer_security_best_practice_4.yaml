    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and block public access settings
      are enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and update the bucket policy to restrict public
      access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the account and the specific bucket.
