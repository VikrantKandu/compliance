    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Enabling server-side encryption helps protect
      sensitive data stored in S3 from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data is
      encrypted at rest, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
      Without encryption, sensitive data might be exposed if unauthorized access occurs.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the "Properties" tab. 4. Verify that "Default encryption"
      is enabled and configured with an appropriate encryption method (e.g., AES-256
      or AWS-KMS).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is not compliant. 3. Go to the "Properties" tab.
      4. Under "Default encryption," select "Enable" and choose the desired encryption
      method. 5. Save the changes to ensure the bucket is encrypted by default.
