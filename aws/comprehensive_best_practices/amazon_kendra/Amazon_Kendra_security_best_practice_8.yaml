    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users
      to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users enhances security by reducing the risk of
      compromised credentials. Without MFA, unauthorized users could gain access to
      AWS resources if they obtain user passwords.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check the 'MFA' column for each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
