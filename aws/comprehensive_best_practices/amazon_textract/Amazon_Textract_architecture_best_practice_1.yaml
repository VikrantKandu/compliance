    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access
      to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive information to
      the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that
      buckets are not publicly accessible minimizes the risk of unauthorized data
      exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the Block Public Access settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
