    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should
      be configured to restrict public access unless explicitly required for a specific
      use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. By ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations
      can protect sensitive data and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      bucket ACLs.
    - Ensure there are no permissions granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Re-evaluate the necessity of public access and apply least privilege principles.
