    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon EC2 instances are not associated with default
      security groups. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks due to unrestricted access. It is recommended to create specific security
      groups with rules tailored to the instance's needs to minimize the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Ensure that no instance is using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the instance.
    - Attach the newly created security group to the instance.
