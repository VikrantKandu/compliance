    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets in your AWS account are configured
      to prevent public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to safeguard data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not allow public access through its policy or ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access block configuration.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Review and adjust the bucket policy and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
