    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      you can mitigate the risk of data breaches and maintain data privacy and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket access is set to private and that the bucket policy does
      not allow public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list and check
      the permissions of all S3 buckets in your account.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access permissions.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the account
      and bucket level.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
