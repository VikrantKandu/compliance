    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that public access is not granted.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check bucket permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not grant public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable any public access settings.
    - Use bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to specific
      users or roles.
