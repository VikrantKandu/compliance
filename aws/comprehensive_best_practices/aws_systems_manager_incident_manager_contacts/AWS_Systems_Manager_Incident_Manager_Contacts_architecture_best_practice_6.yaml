    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: IAM policies should be attached to groups or roles rather than individual
      users to simplify management and reduce the risk of excessive permissions.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      management and increase the risk of granting excessive permissions. By attaching
      policies to groups or roles, you can more easily manage permissions and ensure
      that users have only the access they need.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Select the "Users" section. 4. For each user, check the "Permissions" tab
      to ensure no policies are directly attached. 5. Verify that policies are attached
      to groups or roles instead.
    Default Value: By default, IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
    Remediation: 1. Identify any IAM policies directly attached to users. 2. Detach
      these policies from users. 3. Create or identify appropriate IAM groups or roles.
      4. Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles. 5. Add users to the
      appropriate groups or assign them to the roles to grant necessary permissions.
