    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires
      users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access, which helps
      protect against compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain access to sensitive information and resources. MFA adds
      an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to list all IAM users and check
      the MFA status for each user. Ensure that MFA is enabled for all users. Specifically,
      run the command aws iam list-users and for each user, run aws iam list-mfa-devices
      --user-name <username> to verify the presence of MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: To enable MFA, navigate to the AWS IAM console, select the user,
      and choose the option to manage MFA. Follow the prompts to assign and activate
      an MFA device for the user. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam enable-mfa-device
      to activate an MFA device for a user.
