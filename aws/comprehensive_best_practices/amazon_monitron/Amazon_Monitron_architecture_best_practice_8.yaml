    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that S3 buckets do not allow public access. Publicly
      accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. It is
      crucial to restrict access to only trusted entities.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to data theft, loss of sensitive
      information, and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs modification.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Save changes and verify the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
