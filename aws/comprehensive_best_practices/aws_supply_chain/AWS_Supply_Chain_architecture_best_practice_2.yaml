    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to your data. Publicly accessible buckets can
      expose sensitive data to the internet, which can lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and breaches.
      Ensuring that buckets are private by default protects against unauthorized access
      and data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and review the Permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access at the account
      level.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but users can modify permissions
      to make them public.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Click on the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access policies or ACLs.
    - Enable the Block Public Access setting to prevent future public access settings.
