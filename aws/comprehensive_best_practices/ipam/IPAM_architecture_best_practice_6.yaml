    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead
      to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in data leaks, unauthorized
      data manipulation, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are
      private mitigates these risks and helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Ensure that the bucket ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy.
    - Adjust the bucket ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings on the bucket level to prevent future
      public access configurations.
