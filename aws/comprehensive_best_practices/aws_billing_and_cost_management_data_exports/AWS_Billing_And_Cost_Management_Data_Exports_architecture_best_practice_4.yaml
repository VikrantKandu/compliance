    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase the risk
      of data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive data and complies
      with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have a policy that allows public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or SDK to programmatically check bucket policies for public access
      permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict public access.
    - Remove any public access permissions in the bucket's ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent future public access configurations.
