  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not have public access permissions.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  - Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can lead to data breaches and
      unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default helps
      protect sensitive information and aligns with security best practices.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and their access policies. 4. Check for any buckets
      with public access permissions enabled.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify the buckets with public access. 2. Update the bucket
      permissions to remove public access. 3. Use bucket policies and IAM roles to
      grant access only to authorized users or services.
