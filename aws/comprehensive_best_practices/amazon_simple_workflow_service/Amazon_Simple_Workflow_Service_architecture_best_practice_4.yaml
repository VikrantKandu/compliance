    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive
      information.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to maintaining the confidentiality
      and integrity of the data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors to access, modify, or delete data, leading to data loss and security
      incidents.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket to review. 4. Check the bucket permissions and ensure that
      no public access is granted. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the bucket's ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI
      command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review the bucket's
      policy for public access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Remove any public access permissions from the bucket's ACL. 2.
      Edit the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access. 3. Enable
      "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket. 4. Regularly review bucket permissions
      and policies to confirm compliance with best practices.
