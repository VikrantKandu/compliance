    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification
      step during login.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account adds an extra layer of security,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, the root account is more
      susceptible to compromise, potentially leading to unauthorized access to all
      resources in the AWS account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check the "Security Status" section on the IAM dashboard.
    - Verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the "My Security Credentials" page.
    - Select "Activate MFA" and follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device
      or hardware MFA device.
    - Confirm the MFA setup by entering the authentication code generated by the MFA
      device.
