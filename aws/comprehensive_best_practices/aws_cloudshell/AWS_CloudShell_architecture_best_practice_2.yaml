    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets poses a significant security risk as it
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with
      data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure it does not grant public access.
    - Verify that the access control list (ACL) does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the access control list (ACL) to restrict public access.
