    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access, safeguarding data from unauthorized exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these
      risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled for each bucket.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private, but configurations may change
      over time.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy to remove any statements granting public
      access.
    - Save the changes to ensure the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
