    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access, enhancing the security of the
      account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, a compromised password could lead to full
      control of the AWS account, potentially resulting in data breaches or resource
      misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Choose the root user.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Choose the root user.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA)', choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the prompts to enable MFA using a virtual MFA device, hardware MFA device,
      or SMS MFA.
