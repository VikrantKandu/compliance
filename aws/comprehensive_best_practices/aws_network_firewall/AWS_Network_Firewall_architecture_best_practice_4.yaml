    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring that bucket policies and access control lists
      (ACLs) do not allow public access is crucial for maintaining data security.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. By restricting public access, organizations can protect sensitive
      information and comply with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket policies and ACLs for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no policies or ACLs allow public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature to enforce restrictions.
    - Utilize AWS CLI or SDKs to programmatically check bucket policies for public
      access permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" setting to prevent future public access configurations.
