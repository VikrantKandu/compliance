    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors, leading to data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and public access settings for each S3 bucket.
    - Verify that no buckets have public access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block Public Access settings and ensure all options are enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
