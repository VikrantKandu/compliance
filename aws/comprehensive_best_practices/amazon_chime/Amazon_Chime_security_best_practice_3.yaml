    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on
      top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect accounts from unauthorized
      access by requiring an additional authentication factor. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to credential theft and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list users with
      MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage" under "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)".
    - Follow the steps to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
