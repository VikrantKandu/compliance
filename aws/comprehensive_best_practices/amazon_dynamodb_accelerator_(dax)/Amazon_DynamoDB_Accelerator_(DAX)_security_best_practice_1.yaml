    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check to ensure that EC2 instances are not associated with the default
      security group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. This is important
      to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unrestricted access to
      your EC2 instances, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches. Custom security groups should be configured to allow only necessary
      traffic.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that no instance is using the default
      security group which typically allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
    Default Value: By default, new EC2 instances may be associated with the default
      security group.
    Remediation: 1. Identify the EC2 instances using the default security group. 2.
      Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the application's requirements. 3. Detach the default security group from
      the instances. 4. Attach the newly created security group to the instances.
