    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase
      the risk of data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public buckets can be
      accessed by anyone on the internet, posing significant security risks.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public access" is
      enabled for each bucket. 4. Check the bucket policy and access control list
      (ACL) to confirm no public access permissions are granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Enable "Block all public
      access" for the bucket. 5. Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      any public access permissions.
