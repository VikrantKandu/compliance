    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are private by default to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can
      expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private by default minimizes the risk of accidental
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
      resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the access permissions of each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to confirm
      the bucket's ACL settings.
    - Check the bucket policy using aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      and ensure it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, but users can change the settings
      to allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to restrict access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to modify the bucket settings.
    - Remove any public access settings from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging to track access requests.
