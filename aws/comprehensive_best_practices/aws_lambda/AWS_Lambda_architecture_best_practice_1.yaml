    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to add an extra layer of security.
      MFA requires users to provide a second form of verification, which helps protect
      against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could gain full access to the account. MFA acts as a second line
      of defense, requiring an additional form of verification.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Review the "MFA" column to check
      if MFA is enabled for each user. 5. Verify that all users have MFA enabled.
      If any user does not have MFA enabled, the check is non-compliant.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, select "Users". 4. Click on the username
      of the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 5. Select the "Security credentials"
      tab. 6. In the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage". 7. Follow the
      prompts to assign an MFA device to the user. 8. Repeat the process for all users
      without MFA enabled.
