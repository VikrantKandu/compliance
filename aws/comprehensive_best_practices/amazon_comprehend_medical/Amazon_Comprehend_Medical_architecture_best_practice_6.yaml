    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead
      to data breaches and sensitive information being exposed to the internet.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      Ensuring that buckets are not public helps maintain data confidentiality and
      integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have "Public" access status.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with the best practice.
