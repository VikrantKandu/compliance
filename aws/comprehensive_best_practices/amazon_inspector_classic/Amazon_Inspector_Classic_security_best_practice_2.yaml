    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible Only When Necessary
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless
      explicitly required. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches if
      sensitive data is exposed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      which poses a significant security risk if sensitive or confidential data is
      stored in them. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access unless explicitly required and documented.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDK to programmatically list bucket policies and ACLs to
      ensure compliance.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Review the bucket's use case to determine if public access is necessary.
    - If public access is not required, update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      access.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to enforce least privilege access.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
