    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using approved Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to maintain security and compliance standards.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that instances are built with a secure
      and consistent baseline, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance
      with organizational policies.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the sidebar to view all running instances.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID and verify it against the list of approved
      AMIs maintained by your organization.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with any publicly available
      AMI, which may not meet security and compliance standards.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Plan and execute a migration strategy to replace non-compliant instances with
      ones using approved AMIs.
    - Update organizational policies and automation scripts to ensure future instances
      are only launched with approved AMIs.
