  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.
  - Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect data stored in
      AWS from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets
      can be accessed by anyone on the internet, increasing the risk of data theft
      and compliance violations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review each bucket's permissions and access settings. 4. Check the Block
      Public Access settings for each bucket. 5. Verify that no bucket is publicly
      accessible unless explicitly intended and necessary.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, navigate to the
      S3 console. 2. Select the bucket with public access. 3. Click on the Permissions
      tab. 4. Enable the Block all public access setting. 5. Review and adjust any
      bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
