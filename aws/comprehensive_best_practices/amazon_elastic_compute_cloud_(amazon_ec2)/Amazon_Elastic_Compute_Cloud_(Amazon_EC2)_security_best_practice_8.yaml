    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of data exposure
      and unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks,
      compliance violations, and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Access the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket settings to ensure the "Block Public Access" option is enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have "Block Public Access" settings
      enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS S3 console.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
