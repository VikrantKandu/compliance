  - Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Not Using Default Security Group
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group, which is open to all inbound traffic by default. Using
      the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary risk.
  - Rationale: Associating EC2 instances with the default security group can lead
      to potential security vulnerabilities as it allows unrestricted inbound access.
      This can result in unauthorized access and potential exploitation of the instances.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu. 4. For each instance, check the
      associated security groups. 5. Verify that none of the instances are using the
      default security group.
  - Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group, which allows unrestricted inbound access.
  - Remediation: 1. Identify EC2 instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with the necessary inbound and outbound rules. 3. Associate
      the new security group with the instances. 4. Remove the default security group
      association from the instances.
