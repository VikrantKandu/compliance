    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access can be granted
      through bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs), which should be reviewed
      and restricted.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting access reduces the risk of data
      exposure and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and policies for each bucket.
    - Check that no bucket has public access settings enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update its ACL to remove public
      access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users or roles.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent public access
      configurations.
