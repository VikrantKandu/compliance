    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      a second form of authentication, enhancing the security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access, as it requires a second form of authentication beyond just
      a password. Without MFA, the root account is vulnerable to password-based attacks,
      potentially compromising the entire AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, choose 'Users'.
    - Select the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', choose 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to enable an MFA device.
    - Verify that MFA is successfully enabled by logging out and logging back in,
      confirming the requirement for MFA.
