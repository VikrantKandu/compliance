    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that no S3 buckets are publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and ensure block public access settings are enabled.
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
