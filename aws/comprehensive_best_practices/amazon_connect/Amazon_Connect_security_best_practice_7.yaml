    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data breaches. Restricting access to only necessary users and
      services mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not include a wildcard (*) principal or allow
      public access.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have the "Public" access status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket requiring remediation.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any wildcard (*) principal or public access
      permissions.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to restrict public access.
    - Save the changes and verify that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
