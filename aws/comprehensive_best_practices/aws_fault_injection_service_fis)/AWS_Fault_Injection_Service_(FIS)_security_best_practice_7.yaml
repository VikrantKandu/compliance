    Title: Ensure CloudWatch Log Group Retention Period is Set
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that a retention period is set for all CloudWatch
      log groups. By default, CloudWatch logs are kept indefinitely, which can lead
      to unnecessary storage costs and potential security risks.
    Rationale: Setting a retention period for CloudWatch logs helps manage storage
      costs and ensures that logs are not retained longer than necessary, reducing
      the risk of exposure of sensitive information.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudWatch
      service. 3. In the left pane, click on 'Log groups'. 4. For each log group,
      check the 'Retention' column to ensure a retention period is set. 5. Alternatively,
      use the AWS CLI command aws logs describe-log-groups and verify the retentionInDays
      attribute for each log group.
    Default Value: By default, CloudWatch logs are retained indefinitely.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the CloudWatch
      service. 3. In the left pane, click on 'Log groups'. 4. Select the log group
      for which you want to set a retention period. 5. Click on 'Actions' and select
      'Edit retention'. 6. Choose an appropriate retention period and click 'Save'.
