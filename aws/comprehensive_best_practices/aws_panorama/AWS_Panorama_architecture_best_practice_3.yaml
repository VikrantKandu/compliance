    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Server-side encryption helps safeguard sensitive
      data by encrypting it using AWS-managed keys or customer-managed keys.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption on S3 buckets protects data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Without encryption, data stored in S3 is
      vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if access controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each S3 bucket and review the properties.
    - Check if 'Default encryption' is enabled for the bucket.
    - Verify that either 'Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)' or 'AWS Key Management
      Service (SSE-KMS)' is selected.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the 'Properties' tab.
    - Under 'Default encryption', enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose either 'Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)' or 'AWS Key Management Service
      (SSE-KMS)'.
    - Save the changes to apply encryption to all new objects stored in the bucket.
