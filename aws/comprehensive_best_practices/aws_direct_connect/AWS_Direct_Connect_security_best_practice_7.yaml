    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials, as it requires an additional authentication factor beyond just
      a password. Without MFA, users are more susceptible to unauthorized access and
      potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Check each user to verify if MFA is enabled by reviewing the 'Security Credentials'
      tab.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to use MFA.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security Credentials' tab.
    - Click on 'Manage' under the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
