    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are private and not
      publicly accessible unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose sensitive data and pose a security risk.
    Rationale: Public S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
      Ensuring buckets are private by default helps safeguard data against accidental
      exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Ensure that no buckets have public access unless required for specific use cases.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check the ACL
        settings.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to review bucket
        policies.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, update the bucket's ACL to remove public
      access.
    - Remove any public bucket policies that allow unauthorized access.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private to
        set the bucket to private.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance.
