    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public accessibility can lead to unauthorized access and data leakage.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      increasing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets
      are private helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that "Block all public access" settings
      are enabled for each bucket.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      ACL settings.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      for any public access policies.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" if not already enabled.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
