    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      intended. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting public
      access helps maintain data privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and bucket policy.
    - Ensure that the bucket does not have a bucket policy or ACL that grants public
      access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to block public access to the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at both the account
      and bucket level.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions and policies to maintain compliance.
