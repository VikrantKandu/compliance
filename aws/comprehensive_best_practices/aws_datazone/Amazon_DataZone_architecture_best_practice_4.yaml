    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something
      that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should
      know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users is a critical security measure that helps
      protect user accounts from being compromised. Without MFA, if a user's password
      is stolen, the account can be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals, potentially
      leading to data breaches and unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select "Users".
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under "Security credentials", select "Manage" next to "Assigned MFA device".
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device.
