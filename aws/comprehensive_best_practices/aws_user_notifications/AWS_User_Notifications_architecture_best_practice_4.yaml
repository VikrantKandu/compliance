    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are using the latest AMI
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon
      Machine Image (AMI) to benefit from the latest security patches and features.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose instances to vulnerabilities that have
      been patched in newer versions. Regularly updating to the latest AMI ensures
      that instances are protected against known security threats.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID and compare it with the latest AMI ID available
      in the AWS Marketplace or your custom AMIs.
    - Confirm that the AMI ID used by the instance matches the latest version.
    Default Value: Instances may not automatically use the latest AMI unless manually
      updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI or update the existing instance by
      launching a new instance from the latest AMI and migrating workloads.
    - Test the new instance to ensure it functions as expected.
    - Decommission the old instance once the new instance is fully operational.
