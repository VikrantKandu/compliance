  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      for accessing AWS resources. It requires users to provide a second form of authentication
      in addition to their password.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
      Without MFA, if a user's password is stolen or guessed, an attacker could gain
      full access to the user's AWS account and resources.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select "Users" from the navigation pane. 4. Check the "MFA" column to verify
      that MFA is enabled for each user.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. Select "Users" and click on the user for whom you want to enable
      MFA. 4. Choose the "Security credentials" tab. 5. Click "Manage" under "Assigned
      MFA device." 6. Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
