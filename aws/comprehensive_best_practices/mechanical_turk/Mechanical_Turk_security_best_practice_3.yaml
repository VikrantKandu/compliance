    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets mitigates the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches, financial
      loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - List all S3 buckets and review their permissions.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access permissions enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check bucket ACLs.
    - Use AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions in the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
