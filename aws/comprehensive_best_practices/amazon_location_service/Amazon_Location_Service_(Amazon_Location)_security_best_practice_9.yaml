    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: MFA adds an extra layer of security to the authentication process
      by requiring users to provide more than one form of verification. This helps
      protect user accounts from unauthorized access, even if the password is compromised.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to your AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised,
      an attacker can gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA provides an
      additional barrier against such attacks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab.
    - Verify that the Assigned MFA device is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, select Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the steps to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
