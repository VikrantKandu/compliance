    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication
      factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a password is compromised, an attacker
      can easily gain access to the account.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each IAM user to ensure that MFA is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to verify
      MFA devices are associated with each user.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, click 'Manage' and follow the prompts
      to assign an MFA device.
