    Title: Ensure RDS Instances are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon RDS instances have encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive information
      and complies with organizational and regulatory requirements.
    Rationale: Encrypting RDS instances is crucial for protecting sensitive data from
      unauthorized access. Without encryption, data at rest is vulnerable to breaches,
      potentially leading to data loss and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - Check the Encryption column for each instance to ensure it is marked as "Enabled."
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws rds describe-db-instances --query
        "DBInstances[*].{DBInstanceIdentifier:DBInstanceIdentifier, StorageEncrypted:StorageEncrypted}"
        to list instances and their encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, RDS instances are not encrypted unless specified during
      creation.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
    - Create a new snapshot of the existing unencrypted RDS instance.
    - Copy the snapshot and enable encryption during the copy process.
    - Restore a new RDS instance from the encrypted snapshot.
    - Update applications to use the new encrypted RDS instance.
    - Delete the unencrypted RDS instance once the migration is complete and applications
      are confirmed to be working.
