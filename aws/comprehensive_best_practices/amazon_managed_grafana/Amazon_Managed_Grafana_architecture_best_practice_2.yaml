    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that the IAM password policy is enabled and configured
      to enforce strong password requirements. This includes settings such as minimum
      password length, requiring numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters.
    Rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy is crucial to prevent unauthorized
      access to AWS resources. Weak passwords can be easily compromised, leading to
      potential security breaches and data loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured with the following settings:
      - Minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the left pane, click on 'Account settings'.
    - Enable the password policy and configure it with the recommended settings:
      - Set a minimum password length of at least 8 characters.
      - Require at least one uppercase letter.
      - Require at least one lowercase letter.
      - Require at least one number.
      - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
    - Save the changes.
