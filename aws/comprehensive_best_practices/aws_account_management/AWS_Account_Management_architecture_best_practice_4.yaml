    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow public read or write access to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive information to
      anyone on the internet, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit: '1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

      2. Navigate to the S3 service.

      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket has ''Public'' access
      status.

      4. Check the bucket policy and ACL settings to confirm that there are no public
      access permissions.

      '
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: '1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

      2. Navigate to the S3 service.

      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.

      4. Modify the bucket policy and ACL settings to remove any public access permissions.

      5. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.'
