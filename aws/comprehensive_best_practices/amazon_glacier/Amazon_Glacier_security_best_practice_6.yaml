    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of sensitive
      information being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket. 4. Check that no buckets have
      public access permissions enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the permissions tab
      and remove any public access permissions. 5. Enable bucket policies or IAM policies
      to restrict access to authorized users only.
