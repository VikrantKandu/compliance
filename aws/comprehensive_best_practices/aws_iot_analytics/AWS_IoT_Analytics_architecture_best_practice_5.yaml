    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access, which can lead
      to data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private protects sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that no public access is granted under the 'Public access settings' section.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      and ensure no entries have 'AllUsers' or 'AuthenticatedUsers' as grantees.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove public access.
    - Use the S3 console to configure the bucket's permissions.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy and block public
      access configurations.
