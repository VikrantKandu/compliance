    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption
      enabled to protect data at rest. Encryption helps protect sensitive data from
      unauthorized access and is a critical component of a secure data storage strategy.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets mitigates the risk of
      data breaches by ensuring that data stored in the cloud is encrypted. Without
      encryption, data may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially if access
      controls are misconfigured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the "Properties" tab.
    - Check if "Default encryption" is enabled and configured with an appropriate
      encryption method such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Default encryption."
    - Choose an encryption method such as AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    - Save changes to apply encryption settings to the bucket.
