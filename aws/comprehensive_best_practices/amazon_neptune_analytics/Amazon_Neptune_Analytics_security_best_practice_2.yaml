    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
      Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data
      exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access sensitive data. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private reduces the risk
      of data breaches and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Check the 'Block Public Access' settings to ensure they are enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings for the bucket.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
