    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in these buckets.
      Public access to S3 buckets should be restricted unless explicitly required
      for specific use cases.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential
      data breaches. Restricting public access helps maintain data confidentiality
      and integrity by ensuring only authorized users can access the contents of the
      buckets.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that should not be publicly accessible.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update the bucket's ACLs to ensure they do not grant public permissions.
