    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: S3 buckets should be configured to be private to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches
      and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is crucial to maintaining data security
      and privacy. Public buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing
      a significant risk to data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Review the permissions of each bucket.
    - Step 4: Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Go to the permissions tab.
    - Step 5: Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Step 6: Disable public access settings on the bucket.
