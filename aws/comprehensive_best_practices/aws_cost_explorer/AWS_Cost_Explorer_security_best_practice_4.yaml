  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
  - Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can result in unauthorized data exposure
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible mitigates
      the risk of data breaches and maintains data privacy and security.
  - Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that "Block all public access" settings are enabled.
    - Check the bucket policy and ensure there are no public access permissions.
    - Review the Access Control List (ACL) to confirm no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Select the bucket and go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" settings.
    - Review and update the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the Access Control List (ACL) to ensure no public access is granted.
