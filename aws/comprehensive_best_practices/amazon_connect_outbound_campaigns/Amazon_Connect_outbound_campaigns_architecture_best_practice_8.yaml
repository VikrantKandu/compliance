    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private and
      not publicly accessible. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive
      data and lead to security breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      potentially exposing sensitive or confidential data. By ensuring buckets are
      private, you reduce the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket ACL is set to private.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs to be made private.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the bucket ACL to ensure it is set to private.
    - Use AWS Config or S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access
      configurations.
