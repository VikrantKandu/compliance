    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      in order to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, as anyone
      on the internet can view or download the contents. By restricting access, you
      can protect sensitive information and comply with data privacy regulations.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the S3 console. 3. Select
      the bucket you want to check. 4. Under the 'Permissions' tab, review the 'Block
      public access' settings. 5. Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Open the S3 console.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access'. 6. Save the changes to ensure the
      bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
