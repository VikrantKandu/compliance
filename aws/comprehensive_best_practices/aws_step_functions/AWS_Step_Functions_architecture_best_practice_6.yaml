    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring users to provide additional verification
      beyond their password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against compromised credentials.
      Without MFA, an attacker with a user's password could gain full access to their
      permissions in AWS, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized resource
      usage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
