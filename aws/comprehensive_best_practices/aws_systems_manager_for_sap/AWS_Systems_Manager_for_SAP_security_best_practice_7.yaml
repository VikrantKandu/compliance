    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can be accessed by anyone on
      the internet, which may result in unauthorized data access or data breaches.
      Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps in maintaining data
      privacy and security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check each bucket's permissions and ensure that the 'Block all public access'
      setting is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket ACL does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on 'Permissions' and ensure 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
