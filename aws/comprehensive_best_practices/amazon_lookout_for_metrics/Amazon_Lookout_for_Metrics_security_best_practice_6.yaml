    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to user accounts by requiring not just a password but also a second form of
      verification. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access in case of compromised
      credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps mitigate the risk of account compromise
      due to stolen or weak passwords. Without MFA, unauthorized users can gain access
      to AWS resources, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation,
      and service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the list of IAM users and verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to programmatically verify MFA status for all users.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select the user account.
    - Under the Security Credentials tab, click on Manage MFA Device.
    - Follow the instructions to enable and configure an MFA device for the user.
