    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that a password policy is enabled for AWS Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) to enforce strong password requirements.
    Rationale: Enabling a strong password policy helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized
      access by enforcing complexity, length, and rotation requirements. Without a
      password policy, accounts are at risk of being compromised through weak or easily
      guessed passwords.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Account settings' in the left navigation pane.
    - Verify that a password policy is set and meets the organization's security requirements.
    Default Value: By default, IAM does not enforce any password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on 'Account settings' in the left navigation pane.
    - Click 'Set password policy' and configure the policy to enforce requirements
      such as minimum length, complexity, and rotation.
    - Save the changes to apply the new password policy.
