    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of
      security. MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors to
      gain access to AWS resources, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. If credentials are compromised, MFA provides an additional
      security layer that can prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive
      resources.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, click on 'Users'.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, click on 'Users'.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click on the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under the 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)' section, click 'Assign MFA device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
