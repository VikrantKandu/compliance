    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps secure
      AWS environments by requiring additional verification before granting access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, especially
      if passwords are compromised. Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of
      account breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA Device' column to ensure an MFA device is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the sidebar.
    - Click on each user and select 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', select 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign
      an MFA device.
