  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and potential security
      breaches. It is crucial to restrict access to sensitive data stored in S3.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet,
      leading to unauthorized data access and potential data leaks. By ensuring S3
      buckets are not publicly accessible, organizations can protect sensitive data
      and comply with data protection regulations.
  - Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each S3 bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure that
      public access is blocked.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access by reviewing the bucket
      policy and access control list (ACL).
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured to do so.
  - Remediation:
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the S3 bucket.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Regularly review and audit S3 bucket configurations to maintain compliance with
      security best practices.
