    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Have Server-Side Encryption Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled
      to protect data at rest.
    Rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets ensures that data is
      encrypted when stored, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the properties to verify that server-side encryption
      is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
        to check the encryption status.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose the appropriate encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to enable encryption: aws s3api put-bucket-encryption
        --bucket <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'.
