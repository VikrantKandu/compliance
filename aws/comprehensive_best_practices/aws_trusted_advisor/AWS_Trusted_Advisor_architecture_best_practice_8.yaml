    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of the username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account credentials are compromised,
      an attacker could have full access to the account, leading to potential data
      breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, select "Users" and then click on the root account.
      4. Under "Security credentials", check if MFA is enabled. 5. If MFA is not enabled,
      this check is non-compliant.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the root account.
      2. Navigate to the "My Security Credentials" page. 3. Under "Multi-Factor Authentication",
      click "Activate MFA". 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up a virtual
      MFA device or hardware MFA device. 5. Confirm the setup to enable MFA for the
      root account.
