    Title: Ensure IAM Password Policy is Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that a strong password policy is enabled for IAM users to
      enhance account security by enforcing password complexity and rotation.
    Rationale: A strong password policy reduces the risk of unauthorized access to
      AWS resources by enforcing password complexity and regular rotation, which are
      critical for protecting sensitive data and services.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on Account settings.
    - Verify that the password policy is enabled and configured with the recommended
      settings, such as minimum length, requiring symbols, numbers, uppercase, and
      lowercase letters, and password expiration.
    Default Value: By default, AWS does not enforce a password policy.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on Account settings.
    - Enable the password policy and configure it to require at least 8 characters,
      including symbols, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.
    - Set the password expiration period and enable password history to prevent reuse.
