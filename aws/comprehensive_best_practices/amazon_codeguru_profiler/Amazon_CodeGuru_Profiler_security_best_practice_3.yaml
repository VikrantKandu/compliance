    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and increase
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect sensitive information
      and adhere to compliance requirements.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control list (ACL) settings for
      each bucket. 4. Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
      5. Utilize AWS CLI or AWS SDK to list bucket policies and ACLs programmatically
      for verification.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Review and edit the bucket permissions to disable
      public access. 4. Update the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow
      public access. 5. Use the Block Public Access feature to ensure no public access
      is allowed.
