    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Public
      buckets can be accessed by anyone on the internet, posing a significant security
      risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and review its permissions settings.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure that public access is restricted.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm no public
      access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are created with public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
