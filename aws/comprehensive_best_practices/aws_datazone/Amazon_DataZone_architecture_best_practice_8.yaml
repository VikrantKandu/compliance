    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public access
      enabled. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can be exploited by malicious actors
      to access or modify sensitive data. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Verify that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the bucket policy
      and access control list (ACL).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that needs remediation.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting for the bucket.
