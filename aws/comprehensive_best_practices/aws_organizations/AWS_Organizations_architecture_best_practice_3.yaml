    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that buckets are private by default reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access policies for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket policy or ACL grants public read or write access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACL to remove public access.
    - Consider using AWS S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public
      access configurations.
