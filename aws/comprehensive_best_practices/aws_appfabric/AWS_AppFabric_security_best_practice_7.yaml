    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched using Amazon Machine Images
      (AMIs) that are approved by your organization. This helps maintain consistency,
      security, and compliance across your AWS environment.
    Rationale: Using approved AMIs ensures that all instances meet organizational
      security and compliance requirements. Non-approved AMIs may contain vulnerabilities
      or misconfigurations that could expose the organization to security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - List all running instances and note their AMI IDs.
    - Compare the AMI IDs against the list of approved AMIs maintained by your organization.
    - Identify any instances using non-approved AMIs.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched using any public or private
      AMI.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running on non-approved AMIs.
    - Plan for a migration of these instances to an approved AMI.
    - Launch new instances using approved AMIs and migrate applications and data.
    - Terminate instances running on non-approved AMIs after successful migration.
