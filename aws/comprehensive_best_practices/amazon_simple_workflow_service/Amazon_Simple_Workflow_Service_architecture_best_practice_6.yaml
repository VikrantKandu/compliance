    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not have public access
      permissions, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to unauthorized users. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
      to check the ACL settings and ensure there are no public grants.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket permissions
      to block public access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console to adjust the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI to update the bucket policy with the command
      aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> --policy <policy-json> to
      ensure no public access is allowed.
