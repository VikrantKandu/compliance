    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access,
      which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is critical because it is the most
      privileged account in an AWS environment. If compromised, it could lead to unauthorized
      access to all resources. MFA provides an additional security layer, making it
      harder for attackers to gain access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select Dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the left navigation pane, select Dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click on Activate MFA on your root account.
    - Follow the instructions to enable MFA using a virtual or hardware MFA device.
