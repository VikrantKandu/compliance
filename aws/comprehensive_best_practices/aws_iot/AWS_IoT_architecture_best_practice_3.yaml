    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Do Not Use Default Security Group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group to ensure that only necessary ports and protocols are open. The default
      security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which can expose the
      instance to potential threats.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose EC2 instances to unnecessary
      risks as it allows unrestricted access. By ensuring instances are associated
      with custom security groups, you can define specific inbound and outbound rules,
      enhancing security.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the sidebar menu.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances associated with the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to your needs.
    - Update the instances to use the new security group instead of the default one.
    - Ensure that the default security group has no open inbound rules if it is not
      in use.
