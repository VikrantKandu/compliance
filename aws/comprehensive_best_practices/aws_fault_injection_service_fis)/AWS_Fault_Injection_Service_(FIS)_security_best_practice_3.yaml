  - ID: AWS-001
  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of verification in addition to their
      password. This ensures that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized
      access is still prevented.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to data breaches,
      unauthorized resource usage, and potential financial and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Review each user to ensure MFA
      is enabled by checking the 'MFA device' column.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Click on the individual user
      name. 5. Choose the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. Under 'Assigned MFA device',
      click 'Manage'. 7. Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
