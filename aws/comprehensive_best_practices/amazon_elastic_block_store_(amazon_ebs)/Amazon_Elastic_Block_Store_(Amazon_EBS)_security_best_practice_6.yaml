  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, posing
      security risks.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible helps
      protect sensitive information and complies with security best practices.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each bucket in your account. 4. Ensure
      that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public access.
      5. Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access to buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket. 3. Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove
      any public access permissions. 4. Enable the S3 Block Public Access feature
      to prevent future public access configurations.
