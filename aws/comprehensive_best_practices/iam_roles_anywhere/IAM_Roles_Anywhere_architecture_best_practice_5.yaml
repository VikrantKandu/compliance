    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Approved AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are launched using approved
      Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Approved AMIs are those that have been vetted
      for security and compliance standards.
    Rationale: Using unapproved AMIs can introduce vulnerabilities as they may not
      include the latest security patches or configurations. This can lead to unauthorized
      access or data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select Instances and review the AMI ID for each instance.
    - Verify that each AMI ID matches the list of approved AMIs maintained by your
      organization.
    Default Value: EC2 instances can be launched with any AMI by default.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances not using approved AMIs.
    - Terminate or replace these instances with new ones using approved AMIs.
    - Update policies to restrict the use of unapproved AMIs.
