    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Using Latest AMIs
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon Machine
      Images (AMIs) to ensure they have the latest security updates and features.
    Rationale: Using outdated AMIs can expose EC2 instances to vulnerabilities that
      have been addressed in newer images. Regularly updating to the latest AMI helps
      protect against security threats and ensures compatibility with new AWS features.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID and compare it with the latest available
      AMI for the specific operating system.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are launched with the AMI specified at the time of
      creation, which may not be the latest.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using outdated AMIs.
    - Plan a maintenance window for updating instances.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Migrate applications and data to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance once the migration is complete and verified.
