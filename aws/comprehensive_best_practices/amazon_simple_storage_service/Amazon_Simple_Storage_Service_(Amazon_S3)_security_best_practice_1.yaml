    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are within a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: All EC2 instances should be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC) to ensure network isolation and security.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances within a VPC provides enhanced security by
      allowing you to define network boundaries, control inbound and outbound traffic
      rules, and isolate instances from the public internet. Failure to use a VPC
      may expose instances to security risks such as unauthorized access and data
      breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Check the 'Instances' section and ensure each instance is associated with a
      VPC.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws ec2 describe-instances and verify the 'VpcId' field
      is present for all instances.
    Default Value: By default, instances are launched into the default VPC if no specific
      VPC is chosen.
    Remediation:
    - If any EC2 instances are found outside a VPC, stop the instance.
    - Create a new VPC or choose an existing VPC.
    - Launch a new instance within the VPC, ensuring network configurations are appropriate.
    - Migrate data and configurations from the old instance to the new instance as
      necessary.
    - Terminate the old instance once data migration is complete.
