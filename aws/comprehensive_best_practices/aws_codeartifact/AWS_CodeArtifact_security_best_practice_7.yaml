    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the permissions and ensure that the bucket policy and
      Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>' to
      verify ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command 'aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>'
      to review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings in the S3 console to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review and update bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
