    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public
      access. Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to sensitive data being exposed
      to the internet, which could result in data breaches or unauthorized data access.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Public buckets can be exploited
      by malicious actors if not properly secured.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the 'Block all public access' setting is enabled.
    - Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable the 'Block all public access' option.
    - Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access to ensure
      they comply with security requirements.
