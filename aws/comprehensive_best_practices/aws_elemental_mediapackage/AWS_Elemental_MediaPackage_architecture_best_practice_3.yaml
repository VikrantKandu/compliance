    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the bucket's Access Control List (ACL) settings do not grant public
      read or write permissions.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to restrict public access to all
      buckets in the account.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with the organization's
      security policies.
