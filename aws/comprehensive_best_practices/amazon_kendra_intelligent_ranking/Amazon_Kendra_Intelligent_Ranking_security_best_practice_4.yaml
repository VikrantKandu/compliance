    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access reduces the risk
      of data breaches.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and bucket policy for each bucket. 4. Ensure
      that no bucket is set to public access under the "Block Public Access" settings.
      5. Verify that there are no public access permissions in bucket policies or
      access control lists (ACLs).
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets block public access unless explicitly configured
      otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. 2. Select
      the bucket to be modified. 3. Click on "Permissions" and check the "Block Public
      Access" settings. 4. Enable "Block all public access" and save changes. 5. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
