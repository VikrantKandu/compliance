    Title: Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data breaches. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive
      information.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - 'Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>
      and verify that the ACL does not grant ''Everyone'' or ''AuthenticatedUsers''
      access.'
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Enable 'Block all public access' and save changes.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access is granted.
