    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access can lead to sensitive data
      leaks and security breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are private mitigates this risk.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the bucket does not have public READ or WRITE permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket in question.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Block all public access by selecting the appropriate settings.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
