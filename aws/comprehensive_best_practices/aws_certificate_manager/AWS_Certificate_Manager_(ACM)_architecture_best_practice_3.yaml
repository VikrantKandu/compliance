    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Are Configured with IAM Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are configured with IAM
      roles to manage access to AWS services securely. By assigning IAM roles to EC2
      instances, you can control the permissions for applications running on the instances
      without embedding long-term credentials.
    Rationale: Without IAM roles, applications running on EC2 instances may require
      long-term credentials, which can pose a security risk if compromised. IAM roles
      provide temporary security credentials that automatically rotate, reducing the
      risk of credential exposure and simplifying credential management.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the "IAM role" column to ensure an IAM role is assigned.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances` and verify
      the "IamInstanceProfile" field for each instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances do not have IAM roles assigned.
    Remediation:
    - Identify the IAM role that provides the necessary permissions for the application
      running on the EC2 instance.
    - Assign the IAM role to the EC2 instance via the AWS Management Console or AWS
      CLI.
    - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 dashboard, select the instance,
      click on "Actions," then "Instance Settings," and choose "Attach/Replace IAM
      Role."
    - In the AWS CLI, use the command `aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id
      <instance-id> --iam-instance-profile Name=<role-name>`.
