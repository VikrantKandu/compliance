    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access. The root account has full access to all resources, and
      its compromise can lead to severe security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section to verify if MFA is enabled for the root account.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam get-account-summary and verify
        that the AccountMFAEnabled key is set to 1.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard and select the root account settings.
    - Follow the instructions to enable a virtual MFA device.
    - Ensure that the MFA device is configured correctly and test it to confirm functionality.
