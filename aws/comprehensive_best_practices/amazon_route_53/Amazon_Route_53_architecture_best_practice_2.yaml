    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Check that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access by verifying
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs). Publicly accessible buckets
      can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets
      are not public helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, review the bucket policy and ACL settings. 4. Ensure that
      the bucket policy does not allow public access. 5. Check the ACL to ensure that
      there are no public permissions granted. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name> to verify the policy status.
      7. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the ACL.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket
      policy to restrict public access. 2. Update the bucket ACL to remove any public
      permissions. 3. Consider enabling S3 Block Public Access settings for the account
      or individual buckets to prevent future public access.
