    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default protects sensitive
      information and reduces the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket.
    - Check the 'Permissions' tab to verify that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure the ACL
        does not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI: aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to check for
        policies that allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default, with public access blocked unless
      explicitly allowed.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI to update bucket policies: aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket
        <bucket-name> --policy <policy-json> ensuring no public access is granted.
