    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public buckets can expose data to the
      internet, leading to potential data leaks and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api
      get-bucket-policy to review permissions.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings in the S3 console to ensure no public
      access is allowed.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with organizational
      security standards.
