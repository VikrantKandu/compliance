    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access. Restricting access to buckets ensures that only authorized users and
      applications can access the data, reducing the risk of data breaches and enhancing
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket you wish to audit. 4. Check the bucket permissions tab.
      5. Ensure that the bucket policy does not allow public access. 6. Verify that
      the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the non-compliant bucket. 4. Go to the permissions tab. 5. Adjust
      the bucket policy to restrict public access. 6. Enable the "Block all public
      access" setting. 7. Save the changes to apply the new settings.
