    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leakage. Ensuring that buckets are not public by default helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs)
      to ensure they are not set to public.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to verify that public access is blocked
      at the account and bucket levels.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private with no public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket to prevent future public
      access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and conduct audits to ensure compliance.
