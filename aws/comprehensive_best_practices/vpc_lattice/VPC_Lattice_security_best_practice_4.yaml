    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not have public read
      or write access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring that buckets are
      not publicly accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select each bucket and review the "Permissions" tab. 4. Check the "Block
      public access" settings to ensure that public access is restricted. 5. Verify
      that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation: 1. For each bucket with public access, navigate to the "Permissions"
      tab. 2. Enable "Block all public access" to restrict public access. 3. Review
      and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
      4. Consider using AWS IAM policies to restrict access to trusted users and roles.
