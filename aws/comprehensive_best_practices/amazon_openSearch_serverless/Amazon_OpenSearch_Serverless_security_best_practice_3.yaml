    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. S3 buckets should
      be configured to restrict access to only those who require it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data access. Restricting bucket access minimizes the risk of exposing sensitive
      information to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket.
    - Ensure that no buckets have public access enabled.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Disable public access by updating bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature to restrict public access to the bucket.
    - Regularly review and update policies to ensure compliance with security best
      practices.
