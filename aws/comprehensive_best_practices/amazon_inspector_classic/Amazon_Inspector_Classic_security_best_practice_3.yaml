    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security
      for AWS accounts by requiring a second form of authentication. This check ensures
      that all IAM users have MFA enabled to enhance account security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts.
      Without MFA, accounts are more susceptible to compromise, especially if credentials
      are leaked or stolen.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review each user to ensure that MFA is enabled. This can be verified by checking
      the 'MFA' column for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <user-name> for each user to check for MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user that does not have MFA enabled.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click on 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
