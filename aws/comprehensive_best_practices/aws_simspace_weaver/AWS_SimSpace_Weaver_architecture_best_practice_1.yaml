    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. By default, S3 buckets
      are private, but they can be made public, which poses a security risk.
    Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are private helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized
      access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can expose confidential
      information to the internet, leading to compliance violations and reputational
      damage.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the permissions tab for each bucket.
      4. Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) restrict public
      access. 5. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>
      to verify bucket ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket_name> to check bucket policies.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 3. Go to the permissions
      tab and update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict public access. 4. Use the
      "Block Public Access" feature to prevent future public access configurations.
      5. Verify that the changes have been applied by reviewing the bucket's permissions.
