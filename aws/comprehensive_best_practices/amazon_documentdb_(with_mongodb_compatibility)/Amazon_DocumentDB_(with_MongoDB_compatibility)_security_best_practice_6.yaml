    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to
      gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access
      to AWS accounts. If MFA is not enabled, an attacker who gains access to a user's
      password could potentially access sensitive resources and data.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users". 4. For each user, check if "MFA"
      is enabled under the "Security credentials" tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users". 4. For each user,
      click on their name to open the user details page. 5. Under the "Security credentials"
      tab, click "Manage MFA". 6. Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for
      the user.
