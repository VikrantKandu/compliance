    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users and pose a significant security risk.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized
      access. Ensuring that buckets are not public helps protect sensitive data and
      comply with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Verify that the "Block public access" settings are enabled.
    - Confirm there are no bucket policies or ACLs granting public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the non-compliant bucket.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Review and revise bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
