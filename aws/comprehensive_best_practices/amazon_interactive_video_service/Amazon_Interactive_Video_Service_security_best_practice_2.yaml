    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS environment by requiring additional verification for user access.
      This check ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to prevent unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user accounts from being compromised, even
      if the password is leaked or stolen. Without MFA, there is a higher risk of
      unauthorized access to AWS resources, which could lead to data breaches or service
      disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify that "MFA enabled" is set to "Yes" in the user details.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device," click "Manage" and follow the instructions to enable
      MFA.
