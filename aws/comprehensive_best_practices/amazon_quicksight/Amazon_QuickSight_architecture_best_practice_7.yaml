    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to data exposure and unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, go to the Permissions tab.
    - Check the "Block public access" settings to ensure that public access is not
      allowed.
    - Verify bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket that is publicly accessible, go to the Permissions tab.
    - Enable "Block public access" settings to restrict public access.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
