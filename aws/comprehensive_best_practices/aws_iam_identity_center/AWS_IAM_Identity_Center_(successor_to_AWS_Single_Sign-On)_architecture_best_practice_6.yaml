    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group to ensure that they are not inadvertently exposed to open access. Default
      security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which can pose a significant
      security risk.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can lead to unintended exposure of
      instances to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
      data breaches. By ensuring instances are associated with custom security groups
      with specific rules, you can better control and restrict access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Review each instance's security group settings.
    - Ensure no instance is associated with the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group if no other group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select 'Instances' from the left-hand menu.
    - Choose the instance that is using the default security group.
    - Click on 'Actions', then 'Networking', and select 'Change Security Groups'.
    - Assign the instance to the newly created security group.
