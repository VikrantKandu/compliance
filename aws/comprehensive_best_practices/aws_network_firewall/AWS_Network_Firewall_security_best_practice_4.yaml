    Title: Ensure AWS S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that AWS S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. It is crucial to restrict bucket
      access to prevent sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      data modification, and potential legal implications. Ensuring that buckets are
      private protects against these risks and maintains data confidentiality and
      integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and check each bucket's permissions.
    - Ensure that no bucket has 'Public' access status.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      verify the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Adjust the bucket ACL to ensure no public access is granted.
    - Save the changes to enforce the updated access controls.
