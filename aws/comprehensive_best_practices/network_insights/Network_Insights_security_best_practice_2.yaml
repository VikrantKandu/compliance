    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances Have Termination Protection Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances have termination protection
      enabled to prevent accidental termination. Termination protection is a feature
      that prevents an instance from being terminated through the AWS Management Console,
      CLI, or API.
    Rationale: Enabling termination protection reduces the risk of accidental or malicious
      termination of critical EC2 instances. This is particularly important for instances
      running essential services or applications, as their unexpected termination
      could lead to service disruption and data loss.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left navigation pane. 4. For each instance, check
      the "Termination Protection" setting. 5. Verify that termination protection
      is enabled for all critical instances.
    Default Value: By default, termination protection is disabled for EC2 instances.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
      3. Select Instances from the left navigation pane. 4. Choose the instance for
      which you want to enable termination protection. 5. Click on the "Actions" button,
      select "Instance Settings," and then "Change Termination Protection." 6. Check
      the option to enable termination protection and save the changes.
