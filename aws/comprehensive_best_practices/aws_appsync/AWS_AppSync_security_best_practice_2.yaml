    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets may expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data exposure. Ensuring that buckets are private by default reduces the risk
      of data leaks and complies with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' settings
      are enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the access control list for public permissions.
    - Verify that bucket policies do not allow public access by reviewing them in
      the console or using the CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, enable 'Block all public access'
      in the S3 console for the bucket.
    - Review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not allow public
      access.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions and policies to maintain compliance.
