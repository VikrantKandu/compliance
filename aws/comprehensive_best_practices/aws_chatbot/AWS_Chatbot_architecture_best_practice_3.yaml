    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using the default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: EC2 instances should not be associated with the default security
      group. The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can pose a security risk. Custom security groups with specific rules should
      be used to control traffic to and from the instances.
    Rationale: Using the default security group can expose instances to unnecessary
      risks, such as unauthorized access. Custom security groups allow for more granular
      control over network traffic, reducing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security group.
    - Verify that none of the instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: EC2 instances are launched with the default security group if no
      other security group is specified.
    Remediation:
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the instance.
    - Attach the newly created security group to the instance.
