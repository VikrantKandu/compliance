    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to provide an additional
      layer of security. MFA requires users to present two or more separate forms
      of identity before they can access AWS services.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access by requiring a second form of authentication. This is crucial in protecting
      sensitive data and resources from potential security breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify that MFA is configured for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on each user to view their security credentials.
    - Under 'Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)', click 'Manage' and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA.
    - Ensure that all users complete the MFA setup process.
