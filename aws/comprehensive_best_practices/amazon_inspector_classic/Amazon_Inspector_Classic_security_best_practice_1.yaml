    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access
      unless explicitly intended. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leakage. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious
      actors if not properly configured, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
      violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of S3 buckets and their permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) for each bucket to ensure
      that they do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl and aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      to verify that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket to be modified.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to remove public access permissions with the command aws s3api
      put-bucket-acl and aws s3api put-bucket-policy.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to ensure no future public policies or
      ACLs are applied.
