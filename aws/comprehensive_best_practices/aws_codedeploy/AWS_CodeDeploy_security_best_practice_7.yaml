  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Check that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be private to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves ensuring that the
      bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing
      sensitive information to the internet. Ensuring that S3 buckets are private
      mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions for each S3 bucket. 4. Verify that bucket policies
      do not grant public access. 5. Check that ACLs are not set to public-read or
      public-read-write. 6. Use AWS CLI or SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs programmatically
      and ensure no public access is granted.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Modify the bucket policy
      to remove any statements that allow public access. 5. Update the ACLs to remove
      public-read or public-read-write permissions. 6. Enable the "Block Public Access"
      setting for the bucket to prevent future public access configurations.
