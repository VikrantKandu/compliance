    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication in addition
      to a password. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials,
      as it requires an additional factor that an attacker is unlikely to possess.
      Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and unauthorized
      access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Click "Security credentials" and then "Manage MFA".
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
