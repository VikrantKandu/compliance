    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users have multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) enabled to provide an additional layer of security for accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources by requiring a second form of verification. Without MFA, compromised
      credentials could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Review each user to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices for each user to verify MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device
      to the user.
