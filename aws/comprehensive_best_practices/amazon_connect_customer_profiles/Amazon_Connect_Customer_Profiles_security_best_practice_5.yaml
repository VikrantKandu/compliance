    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security.
      MFA provides an additional layer of protection on top of a username and password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for AWS IAM users is a critical security measure that
      helps prevent unauthorized access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if an IAM user's
      credentials are compromised, an attacker could gain access to sensitive resources
      and data. MFA reduces this risk by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the navigation pane, select Users. 4. For each user, check the "MFA" column
      to verify if MFA is enabled. 5. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam
      list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices to programmatically check for MFA devices
      associated with each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA. 4. Choose the Security credentials
      tab. 5. In the Multi-factor authentication (MFA) section, choose Manage. 6.
      Follow the prompts to assign an MFA device to the user.
