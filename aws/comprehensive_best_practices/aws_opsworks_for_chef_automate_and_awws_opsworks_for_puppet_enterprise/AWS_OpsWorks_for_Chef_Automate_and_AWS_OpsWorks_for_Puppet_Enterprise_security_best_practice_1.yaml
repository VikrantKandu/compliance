  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      required. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Restricting public access minimizes the risk
      of data leakage and unauthorized data exposure.
  - Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and Access Control List (ACL) do not allow public
      access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets.
  - Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
  - Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to modify.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Update the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings for the bucket and account-wide if not already
      enabled.
