    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in your AWS account have multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users adds an extra layer of security by requiring
      a second form of authentication. Without MFA, user accounts are more susceptible
      to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions
      within your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users."
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the "MFA" column.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Click on "Users" and select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - In the "Assigned MFA device" section, click "Manage" and follow the prompts
      to assign an MFA device.
