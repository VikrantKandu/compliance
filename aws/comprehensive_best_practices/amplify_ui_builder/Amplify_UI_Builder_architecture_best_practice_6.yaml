    Title: Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users ensures that
      even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is still prevented.
    Rationale: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.
      Without MFA, an attacker who obtains a user's credentials could gain full access
      to the account, leading to potential data breaches and misuse of resources.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select the 'Users' section.
    - Check each user for the 'MFA enabled' status.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users without MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under 'Security credentials', click 'Manage' next to 'Assigned MFA device'.
    - Follow the steps to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device.
