    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all IAM users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      enabled to add an extra layer of security to AWS accounts.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect user credentials from being compromised.
      Without MFA, a malicious actor who gains access to a user's password can easily
      access AWS resources. MFA requires a second form of verification, reducing the
      risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the "Users" section to verify if MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users with MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard and select the user for whom you want to enable
      MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab.
    - Click on "Manage" in the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
