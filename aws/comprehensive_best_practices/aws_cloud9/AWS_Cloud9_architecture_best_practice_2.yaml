    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      IAM users to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present two
      or more separate forms of identification before gaining access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances security by requiring users to provide a second
      form of authentication, reducing the risk of compromised credentials. Without
      MFA, unauthorized access can occur if credentials are stolen or guessed.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu.
    - Check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled for each user.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu and click on each user.
    - In the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage MFA' and follow the prompts
      to enable MFA.
    - Ensure that all IAM users complete the MFA setup process.
