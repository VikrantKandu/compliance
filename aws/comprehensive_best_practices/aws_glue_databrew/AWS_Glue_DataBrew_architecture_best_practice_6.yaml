    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Encrypted
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to use
      server-side encryption to protect sensitive data at rest. Encryption helps in
      protecting data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Rationale: Encrypting data stored in S3 buckets helps prevent unauthorized access
      to sensitive information. Without encryption, data may be exposed to potential
      breaches, leading to data loss or compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the properties.
    - Check if server-side encryption is enabled for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not have server-side encryption enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Go to the properties section and enable server-side encryption.
    - Choose an appropriate encryption method (e.g., AES-256 or AWS-KMS).
