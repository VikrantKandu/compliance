    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring not only a password but also a second form
      of authentication. This reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect your AWS accounts from unauthorized access
      in case of a compromised password. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to attacks, which could lead to data breaches and unauthorized resource usage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Check each IAM user to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to verify
      that all users have MFA devices assigned.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for IAM users by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose the "Security credentials" tab and click on "Manage" under "Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)".
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device
      to the user.
