    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to enhance security by requiring an additional verification
      factor beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account provides an additional layer of security,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account password
      is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to the AWS environment, leading
      to potential data breaches or resource misuse.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Check the Security Status section for the MFA status of the root account.
    - Confirm that MFA is enabled for the root account.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled for the root account by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
    - Go to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the Security Status section, click on 'Activate MFA on your root account'.
    - Follow the prompts to set up and enable MFA using a virtual MFA device or a
      hardware MFA device.
