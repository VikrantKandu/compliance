    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all IAM users in the AWS account have Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users increases security by requiring an additional
      layer of authentication beyond just a password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access in case of compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" in the "Assigned MFA device"
      section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
