  - Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Root Account
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      account access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because it provides additional
      security against unauthorized access. Without MFA, if the root account credentials
      are compromised, it can lead to unauthorized access to all resources in the
      account, posing significant security risks.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM service.
      3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users." 4. Choose the root account.
      5. Verify that MFA is enabled for the root account.
  - Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default on the AWS root account.
  - Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using the root account. 2.
      Navigate to the IAM service. 3. In the left navigation pane, select "Users."
      4. Choose the root account. 5. Select "Manage MFA" and follow the instructions
      to enable MFA for the root account.
