    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security to user sign-in processes by requiring an additional form of authentication
      beyond just a password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts, as it requires a second form of authentication. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches
      and unauthorized actions within your AWS environment.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA enabled" status.
    - Ensure that MFA is enabled for all users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user without MFA, select the user name.
    - Choose "Security credentials" tab.
    - Under "Assigned MFA device", choose "Manage".
    - Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
