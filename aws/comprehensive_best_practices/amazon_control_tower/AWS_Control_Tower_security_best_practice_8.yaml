    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by
      attackers to access, modify, or delete data, leading to potential data breaches
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Ensure that there are no public access permissions set on the bucket or its
      objects.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab and review the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Remove any policies or ACL entries that allow public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
