    Title: Ensure EC2 Instances are Launched in a VPC
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private
      Cloud (VPC) to enhance security and provide network isolation. Launching instances
      in a VPC allows for better control over network settings and access.
    Rationale: Launching EC2 instances in a VPC provides enhanced security features
      such as security groups and network ACLs, allowing for granular control over
      inbound and outbound traffic. Not using a VPC could expose instances to unnecessary
      risks, such as unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Under Instances, review the list of instances.
    - Confirm that each instance is associated with a VPC by checking the 'VPC ID'
      column.
    Default Value: By default, new AWS accounts have a default VPC in each region,
      and instances are launched within this VPC unless specified otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Identify any instances not launched within a VPC.
    - Plan a migration strategy to move these instances to a VPC.
    - Utilize AWS tools like VPC Peering or AWS Direct Connect for seamless migration
      if needed.
