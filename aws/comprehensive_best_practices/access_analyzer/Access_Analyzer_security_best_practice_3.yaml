    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading
      to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you can prevent
      unauthorized access to your data, reducing the risk of data leaks and breaches.
      Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors to access or
      manipulate data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and check the "Permissions" tab.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name>`
      to verify the ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the "Permissions" tab and enable the "Block all public access" setting.
    - Review and adjust bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they do not grant public
      access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command `aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> --acl
      private` to set the bucket ACL to private.
