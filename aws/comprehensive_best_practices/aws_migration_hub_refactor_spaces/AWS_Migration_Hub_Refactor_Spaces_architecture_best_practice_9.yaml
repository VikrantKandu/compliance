  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1
  - Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Publicly
      accessible S3 buckets can expose data to the internet, leading to data breaches
      and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This can lead to data leaks,
      unauthorized data manipulation, and potential compliance issues with data protection
      regulations.
  - Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
      4. Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access. 5. Use
      the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket_name> to verify
      the ACL settings. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket
      <bucket_name> to review the bucket policy.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket
      policy to restrict public access. 2. Update the bucket ACL to remove any public
      permissions. 3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account or specific
      buckets. 4. Regularly review and audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure compliance
      with security best practices.
