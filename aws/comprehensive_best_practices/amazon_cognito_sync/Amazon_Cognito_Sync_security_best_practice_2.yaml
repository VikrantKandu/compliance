    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access and
      data leakage. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure they do not allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to run the command: aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
        <bucket-name> and verify that no public access is granted.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private and do not allow
      public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and access control
      list (ACL).
    - Enable the "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
