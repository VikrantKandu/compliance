    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive data is
      exposed to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets is crucial to protect sensitive
      data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
      buckets can expose data to the internet, leading to compliance violations and
      security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) do not grant public
      access.
    - Use the 'Block Public Access' settings to verify that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable 'Block Public Access' settings to prevent future public access configurations.
