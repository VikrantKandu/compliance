    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users have
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance account security. MFA adds
      an extra layer of protection on top of the username and password by requiring
      a second form of verification.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional security measure to prevent unauthorized
      access to AWS accounts. Without MFA, if an IAM user's credentials are compromised,
      the attacker can gain full access to the account. MFA significantly reduces
      this risk by requiring a second factor that only the legitimate user possesses.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the "MFA" column to ensure MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users and aws iam list-mfa-devices
      to verify MFA devices are configured for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the "Security credentials" tab, click "Manage" in the "Assigned MFA device"
      section.
    - Follow the prompts to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
