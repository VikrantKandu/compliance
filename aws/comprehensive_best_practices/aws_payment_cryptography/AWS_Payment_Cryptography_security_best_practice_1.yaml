    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information, posing significant security risks.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that no bucket has public access
      enabled.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to check and configure settings for each
      bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      immediately.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to block public access at the bucket
      and account level.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure compliance
      with security policies.
