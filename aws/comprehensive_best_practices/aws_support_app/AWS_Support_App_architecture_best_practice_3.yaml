    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are configured to prevent public
      access, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks, unauthorized
      access, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are not public protects
      sensitive data and maintains compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket permissions.
    - Verify that the bucket does not have public access enabled.
    - Confirm that the bucket policy and ACLs do not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the Permissions tab.
    - Disable public access by adjusting the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting.
