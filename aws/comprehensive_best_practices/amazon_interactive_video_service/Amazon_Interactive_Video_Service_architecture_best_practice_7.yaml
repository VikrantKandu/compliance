    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that all EC2 instances are using the latest Amazon
      Machine Images (AMIs) to benefit from the latest security patches and updates.
      Using outdated AMIs can leave instances vulnerable to security threats.
    Rationale: Regularly updating AMIs is crucial to protect against vulnerabilities
      that have been patched in newer versions. Failure to update can lead to exposure
      to known security threats, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select Instances from the left-hand menu.
    - For each instance, check the AMI ID and compare it with the latest available
      AMI ID for the operating system being used.
    - Verify if the AMI ID matches the latest available version.
    Default Value: Instances may be launched with older AMIs if not explicitly updated.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances running outdated AMIs.
    - Create a new instance using the latest AMI.
    - Test the new instance to ensure functionality.
    - Migrate workloads from the old instance to the new instance.
    - Terminate the old instance once migration is complete.
