    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3.
    Rationale: Keeping S3 buckets private is critical to prevent unauthorized access
      to data. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing sensitive
      information to the internet.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL do not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to review
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private unless configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is not compliant.
    - Update the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Modify the ACL settings to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting in the bucket permissions tab.
