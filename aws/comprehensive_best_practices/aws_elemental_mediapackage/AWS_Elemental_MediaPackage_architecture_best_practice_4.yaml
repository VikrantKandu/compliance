    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all S3 buckets are set to private to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required and justified.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      reduces the risk of accidental exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their access policies.
    - Verify that each bucket's access control is set to private and does not allow
      public access.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket
      <bucket-name> to check the ACL settings programmatically.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default unless explicitly made public.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be public, navigate to the S3 console.
    - Select the bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Edit the Block public access settings to ensure all public access is blocked.
    - Review and update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict access to only authorized
      users.
