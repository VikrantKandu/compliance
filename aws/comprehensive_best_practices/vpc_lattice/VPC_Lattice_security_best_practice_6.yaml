    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access
      to sensitive information. It is crucial to ensure that buckets are configured
      to restrict public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Unauthorized users can access,
      modify, or delete data, leading to data breaches and potential financial or
      reputational damage.
    Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of buckets and check the 'Access' column for any buckets
      marked as 'Public'. 4. For each bucket, click on the bucket name to open the
      bucket details. 5. Go to the 'Permissions' tab and verify that 'Block all public
      access' is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that is publicly accessible. 4. Go to the 'Permissions'
      tab. 5. Enable 'Block all public access' to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible. 6. Review and remove any bucket policies or access control lists
      (ACLs) that grant public access.
