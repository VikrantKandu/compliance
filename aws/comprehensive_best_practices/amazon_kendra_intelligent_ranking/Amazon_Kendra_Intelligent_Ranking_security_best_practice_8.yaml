    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that all S3 buckets do not allow public access to prevent unauthorized
      data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches if sensitive
      information is exposed. Restricting access reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leakage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that no bucket has public access enabled by checking the bucket policy
      and ACL settings.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" feature to prevent public access settings from
      being applied to the bucket.
