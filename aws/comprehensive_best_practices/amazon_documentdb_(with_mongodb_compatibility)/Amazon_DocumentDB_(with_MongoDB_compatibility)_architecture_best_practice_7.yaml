    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private reduces the risk of data leaks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket and go to the Permissions tab.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not allow public access.
    - Check the Block Public Access settings to ensure they are enabled.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the affected bucket.
    - Go to the Permissions tab and modify the bucket policy to restrict public access.
    - Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access.
