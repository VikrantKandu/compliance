    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are configured to prevent
      public access. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      making it crucial to restrict public access unless explicitly required.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets pose a significant security risk as
      they can expose sensitive data to the internet. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket you wish to audit.
    - Step 4: Check the bucket's permissions to ensure that public access is blocked.
    - Step 5: Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Navigate to the S3 bucket settings in the AWS Management Console.
    - Action 2: Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled under the bucket
        permissions.
    - Action 3: Review and modify any bucket policies or ACLs to remove public access
        permissions.
    - Action 4: Regularly review and audit bucket settings to maintain compliance.
