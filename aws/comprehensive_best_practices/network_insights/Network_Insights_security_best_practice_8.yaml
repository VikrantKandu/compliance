    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to provide an additional layer of security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account is crucial because it adds an extra
      layer of security beyond just a password. The root account has unrestricted
      access to all resources in the AWS account, and if compromised, could lead to
      significant security breaches and data loss.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Go to the IAM (Identity and
      Access Management) section. 3. In the navigation pane, select 'Users'. 4. Check
      the 'MFA' column for the root account to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Go
      to the 'My Security Credentials' section. 3. Select 'Activate MFA' and follow
      the instructions to enable MFA for the root account.
