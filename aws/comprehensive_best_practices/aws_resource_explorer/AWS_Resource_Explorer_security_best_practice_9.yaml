    Title: Ensure EC2 instances have limited access to the internet
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that EC2 instances are not directly exposed to
      the internet unless absolutely necessary. By limiting access, you reduce the
      risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation.
    Rationale: Direct exposure of EC2 instances to the internet increases the risk
      of security breaches, unauthorized access, and potential data loss. Limiting
      access to only necessary instances helps maintain a secure environment.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Step 3: Check the security groups associated with each EC2 instance.
    - Step 4: Verify that security groups do not allow unrestricted inbound access
        from the internet (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) on critical ports.
    - Step 5: Ensure instances that require internet access are behind a load balancer
        or use NAT gateways.
    Default Value: EC2 instances may have unrestricted internet access by default
      if not configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Review and update security group rules to restrict inbound access
        to specific IP ranges or use VPNs.
    - Action 2: Use AWS services like NAT gateways or bastion hosts for instances
        that need internet access.
    - Action 3: Regularly audit and update security groups to ensure compliance with
        least privilege principles.
