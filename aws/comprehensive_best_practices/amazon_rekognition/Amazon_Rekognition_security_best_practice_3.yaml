    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. By default, S3 buckets are private,
      but misconfigurations can lead to public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. Ensuring buckets are not public helps protect data
      integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
    - Check the bucket policy for any statements that allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove any public access permissions
      from the bucket policy and ACLs.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to apply blanket restrictions on public
      access.
    - Regularly review bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with access control
      policies.
