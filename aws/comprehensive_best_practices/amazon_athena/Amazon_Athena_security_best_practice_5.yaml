    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets with public access can lead to unintended data exposure.
      Ensuring buckets are private helps protect sensitive information and complies
      with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review each bucket's permissions and policies.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for all buckets.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Adjust the bucket policy to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update any bucket access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
