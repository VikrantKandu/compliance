    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Publicly Accessible Only When Necessary
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      unless explicitly required for business purposes. Public access can lead to
      data exposure if not properly managed.
    Rationale: Limiting public access to S3 buckets reduces the risk of unauthorized
      data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets can be
      exploited by malicious actors to access sensitive information.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the bucket permissions and access control settings.
    - Check if the bucket policy or ACL grants public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket <bucket-name>
      to verify the public access configuration.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If public access is not necessary, update the bucket policy and ACL to restrict
      access.
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to remove any public access grants.
    - Implement bucket policies that explicitly deny public access unless required.
    - Regularly review and update access permissions to ensure compliance with security
      policies.
