  - Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring a second form of authentication. This check
      ensures that all IAM users have MFA enabled to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of user accounts by requiring a
      second factor of authentication, reducing the risk of compromised credentials
      leading to unauthorized access to AWS resources.
  - Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check if MFA is enabled
      under the Security credentials tab. 5. Verify that all users have a device assigned
      under the Assigned MFA device section.
  - Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
  - Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Under Security credentials, choose Manage MFA device.
      6. Follow the instructions to assign an MFA device to the user.
