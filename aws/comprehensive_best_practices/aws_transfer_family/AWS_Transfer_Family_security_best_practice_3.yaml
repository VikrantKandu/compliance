    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting public access helps protect
      sensitive data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    - Check the "Block Public Access" settings for each bucket to confirm they are
      enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets do not allow public access unless explicitly
      configured.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Update the bucket policy to remove public access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and adjust the bucket's access control list (ACL) to restrict public
      access.
