    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. This check involves verifying that bucket
      policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. By ensuring buckets are private, you reduce the risk of sensitive
      information being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the list of buckets and their permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and ACLs for each bucket to ensure they do not allow
      public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to ensure no public access is allowed.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from bucket policies and ACLs.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the bucket.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure they meet your security
      requirements.
