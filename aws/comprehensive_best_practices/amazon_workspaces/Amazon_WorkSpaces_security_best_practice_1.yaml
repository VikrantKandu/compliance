    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Amazon S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible unless explicitly
      required. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are private by default
      mitigates the risk of accidental data exposure.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      check the bucket ACL settings.
    - Ensure that no bucket policies allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are private by default.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the permissions tab and enable "Block all public access."
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    - Use AWS CLI command aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private
      to set the bucket ACL to private.
