    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible,
      which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting access to authorized
      users only is crucial for data protection.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Check the bucket policy to ensure it does not allow public access.
    - Verify that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the account and
      individual buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      restrict access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the account and individual buckets.
    - Review and update ACLs to ensure only authorized users have access.
