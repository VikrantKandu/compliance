    Title: Ensure IAM Users Have MFA Enabled
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      users have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. MFA adds an extra layer
      of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to
      gain access to AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      credentials. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can
      gain unauthorized access to AWS resources. MFA helps protect sensitive data
      and operations by requiring an additional verification factor.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Review the MFA column to ensure each user has MFA enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-users followed by aws iam
      list-mfa-devices --user-name <username> to check MFA status for each user.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are created without MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, click on Manage MFA device.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
