    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to provide an additional layer of security. MFA requires users
      to present two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA increases the security of user accounts by requiring multiple
      forms of verification. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized
      access through compromised credentials, leading to potential data breaches and
      unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA devices.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service and select 'Users'.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and click 'Manage' under 'Assigned MFA
      device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign a virtual or hardware MFA device to the user.
