    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      maintain data privacy and security. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive
      data to unauthorized users.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches as unauthorized
      users may access and exploit sensitive information. Ensuring buckets are private
      reduces the risk of data exposure and complies with data protection regulations.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the bucket permissions and ensure that 'Block all public access' is
      enabled for each bucket. 4. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl
      --bucket <bucket-name> to check the ACL of each bucket. 5. Verify that no bucket
      has a policy allowing public access using the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name>.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service
      and select the affected bucket. 3. Click on the 'Permissions' tab. 4. Enable
      'Block all public access' to restrict public permissions. 5. Remove any bucket
      policy or ACL entries that allow public access.
