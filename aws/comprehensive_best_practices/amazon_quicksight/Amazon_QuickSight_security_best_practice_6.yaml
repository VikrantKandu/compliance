    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Management Console
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that all users accessing the AWS Management Console are required
      to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring
      users to provide not only a password but also a second factor, such as a code
      from an MFA device. This helps protect against compromised credentials.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the Security credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for users in the AWS Management
      Console.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, choose the Security credentials tab.
    - Click on Manage MFA and follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
