    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access to
      their contents. Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
      data exposure, and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates
      these risks.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs) for each bucket.
    - Verify that the bucket policy does not include statements that allow public
      access.
    - Confirm that the "Block Public Access" settings are enabled for the bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, immediately update the bucket
      policy to restrict access.
    - Enable "Block Public Access" settings for the bucket.
    - Review and update ACLs to ensure they do not grant public access.
    - Regularly audit bucket permissions to prevent future public exposure.
