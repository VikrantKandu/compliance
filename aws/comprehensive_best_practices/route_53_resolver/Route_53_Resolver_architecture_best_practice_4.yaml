    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability:
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      to your AWS account by requiring users to provide a unique authentication code
      from an MFA device in addition to their usual credentials. Enabling MFA for
      all IAM users helps protect against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker can
      gain full access to your AWS environment. MFA significantly reduces the risk
      of unauthorized access by requiring a second form of authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command 'aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices' to
      list all MFA devices and verify their association with users.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Select the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - In the 'Assigned MFA device' section, choose 'Manage'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
