    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users in an AWS account. MFA adds an additional layer of security
      by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, enhancing the
      protection of AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources, even if a user's password is compromised. Without MFA,
      accounts are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, password guessing,
      and credential theft.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, verify that MFA is enabled by checking the 'MFA' column for a
      device.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to
        list users with MFA enabled.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on a user to view their details.
    - Choose the 'Security credentials' tab.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the prompts to assign
      an MFA device.
    - Repeat these steps for each IAM user without MFA.
