    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of
      security for accessing AWS resources by requiring not only a password but also
      a second factor of authentication. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users significantly reduces the risk of compromised
      accounts due to password theft or phishing attacks. Without MFA, unauthorized
      users could gain access to sensitive AWS resources and data.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled under the Security credentials tab.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select Users from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the Security credentials tab, click on Manage MFA.
    - Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA for the user.
