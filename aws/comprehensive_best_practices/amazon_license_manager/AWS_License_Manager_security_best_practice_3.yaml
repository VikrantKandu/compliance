    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check verifies that EC2 instances are not associated with the
      default security group. Using the default security group can expose instances
      to unnecessary risk as it allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default.
    Rationale: The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic,
      which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. By ensuring instances
      are not using the default security group, you can apply more restrictive and
      specific rules that align with your security policies.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
      3. Select 'Instances' from the sidebar. 4. For each instance, check the associated
      security groups. 5. Verify that none of the instances are using the default
      security group.
    Default Value: By default, new instances may use the default security group if
      no other group is specified.
    Remediation: 1. Identify instances using the default security group. 2. Create
      a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules. 3. Associate
      the new security group with the instances. 4. Remove the default security group
      association from these instances.
