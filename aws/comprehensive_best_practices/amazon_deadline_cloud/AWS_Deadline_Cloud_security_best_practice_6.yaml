    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Public access to S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users
      and lead to data breaches.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data access
      and potential data leaks. Ensuring that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy and compliance.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select each bucket and review the bucket permissions.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to confirm that the bucket
      is not publicly accessible.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      the ACL settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      review the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove public access.
    - Use the "Block Public Access" settings to ensure the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    - Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access
      to authorized users only.
