    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets is crucial for protecting sensitive
      data. Publicly accessible buckets can be exploited by malicious actors, leading
      to data leaks and potential financial and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select a bucket to review.
    - Check the bucket permissions and ensure that there are no public access settings
      enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to programmatically
      verify the access control list (ACL) settings.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check for any bucket policies allowing public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access to buckets and
      objects.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and policies to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
