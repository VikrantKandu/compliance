    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to
      prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets can
      lead to data breaches and data leaks.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
      users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring
      that S3 buckets are private helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Review the list of S3 buckets and check their access permissions. 4. Ensure
      that the bucket policies and ACLs do not allow public access. 5. Use the S3
      Block Public Access feature to ensure that public access is blocked.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are private and do not allow public
      access.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. Select the bucket that needs remediation. 4. Update the bucket policy and
      ACLs to remove any public access permissions. 5. Enable the Block Public Access
      feature for the bucket to prevent future public access.
