    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private by Default
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private by default, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: By default, S3 buckets are publicly accessible, which can lead to data
      breaches if sensitive information is stored. Ensuring buckets are private reduces
      the risk of unauthorized data access.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions for each bucket.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy and ACL settings do not allow public access.
    Default Value: S3 buckets are publicly accessible by default.
    Remediation:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and select the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket you want to make private.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Edit the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the bucket settings.
