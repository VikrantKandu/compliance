    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public access to S3 buckets
      can lead to data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
    Rationale: Restricting public access to S3 buckets minimizes the risk of unauthorized
      access and data leaks. Publicly accessible buckets can be accessed by anyone
      on the internet, potentially exposing sensitive data and violating compliance
      requirements.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that there are no bucket policies or ACLs that allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable 'Block all public access' for each S3 bucket.
    - Action 2: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to restrict public access.
    - Action 3: Implement IAM policies to control access based on the principle of
        least privilege.
