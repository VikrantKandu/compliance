    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure or unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. Ensuring buckets are not publicly
      accessible helps protect data integrity and confidentiality.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket permissions and ensure that no bucket policies or ACLs grant
      public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to check
      the bucket ACL.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      check the bucket policy.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any bucket policies or ACLs that grant public access.
    - Use the AWS S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure compliance with
      security policies.
