    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data. Ensuring buckets are private helps protect data confidentiality and integrity,
      reducing the risk of data breaches and compliance issues.
    Audit:
    - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Open the Amazon S3 console.
    - Review the bucket list and identify any buckets with a "Public" indicator.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) to ensure
      it does not allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Review and modify the bucket policy and ACL to remove any public access permissions.
    - Enable bucket versioning and logging to monitor access requests.
