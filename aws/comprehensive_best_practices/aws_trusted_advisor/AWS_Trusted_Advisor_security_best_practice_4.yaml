    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance security by requiring
      a second form of authentication.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users
      to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized
      access to AWS resources if credentials are compromised.
    Audit: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. For each user, check if 'MFA'
      is enabled by reviewing the 'MFA' column. 5. Ensure that all users have 'MFA'
      enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
      3. Select 'Users' from the navigation pane. 4. Choose the user for whom you
      want to enable MFA. 5. Click on the 'Security credentials' tab. 6. In the 'Multi-factor
      authentication (MFA)' section, choose 'Manage'. 7. Follow the instructions to
      assign an MFA device to the user.
