    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: Public access to S3 buckets can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
      data loss, or financial liabilities. Ensuring buckets are not publicly accessible
      helps protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with data protection
      regulations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Ensure that 'Block all public access' is enabled.
    - Verify that no bucket policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have all public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access.'
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
