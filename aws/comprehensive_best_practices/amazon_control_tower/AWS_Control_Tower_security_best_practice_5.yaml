  - ID: AWS-S3-001
  - Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not Publicly Accessible
  - Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
  - Description: This check verifies that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.
      Publicly accessible buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public exposure can lead to data leaks,
      financial loss, and reputational damage.
  - Audit: 1. Log into the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the S3 service.
      3. For each bucket, check the bucket permissions and bucket policy. 4. Verify
      that the bucket does not have public access permissions enabled. 5. Use the
      AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to confirm that
      the ACL does not allow public access. 6. Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy
      --bucket <bucket-name> to ensure the policy does not grant public access.
  - Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
  - Remediation: 1. If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, remove public
      access permissions. 2. Modify the bucket policy to restrict access to specific
      AWS IAM roles or users. 3. Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent
      future public access.
