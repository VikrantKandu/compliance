    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent
      unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves checking bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to confirm that public access is not allowed.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and exposure
      of sensitive information. By ensuring the buckets are not public, you mitigate
      the risk of unauthorized data access and potential compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and for each bucket, check the 'Access' column for any
      indication of public access.
    - Click on each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that bucket policies and ACLs do not grant public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to list bucket policies and ACLs for programmatic verification.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - If a bucket is found to be publicly accessible, update the bucket policy to
      remove any statements allowing public access.
    - Modify the ACL to ensure only authorized users or roles have access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings for the account and individual buckets
      to prevent future public access configurations.
