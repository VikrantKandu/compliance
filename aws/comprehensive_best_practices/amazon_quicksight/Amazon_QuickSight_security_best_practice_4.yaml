    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. MFA adds an extra layer of security
      by requiring users to present two or more separate forms of identification before
      accessing AWS resources.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA enhances the security of AWS accounts by preventing unauthorized
      access, even if credentials are compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more
      susceptible to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and
      unauthorized actions.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'Security credentials' tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Choose the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Go to the 'Security credentials' tab and select 'Manage MFA device'.
    - Follow the instructions to assign and activate a virtual MFA device for the
      user.
