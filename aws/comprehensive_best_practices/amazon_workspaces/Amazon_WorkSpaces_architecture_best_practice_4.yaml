    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the AWS
      root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate forms of identification before gaining access, which significantly
      reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Rationale: The AWS root account has unrestricted access to all resources in the
      account. If compromised, it can lead to significant security breaches and data
      loss. Enabling MFA on the root account helps protect it from unauthorized access,
      even if the password is compromised.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user with sufficient
      permissions. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane,
      click on 'Users'. 4. Select the root account. 5. Verify if MFA is enabled by
      checking the 'MFA Device' status.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled on the AWS root account.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 2. Navigate
      to the IAM Dashboard. 3. In the left navigation pane, click on 'Users'. 4. Select
      the root account. 5. Click on 'Manage MFA'. 6. Follow the prompts to enable
      and configure MFA using a compatible device.
