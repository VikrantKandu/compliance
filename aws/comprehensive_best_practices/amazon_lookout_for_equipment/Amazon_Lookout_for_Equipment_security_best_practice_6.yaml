    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
      for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. MFA requires
      users to provide a second form of verification, typically a code from a mobile
      device, in addition to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA for IAM users helps protect user accounts from unauthorized
      access, even if a password is compromised. Without MFA, accounts are more vulnerable
      to phishing attacks and other security threats.
    Audit: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
      3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. For each user, check the Security
      Credentials tab to verify if MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the IAM
      Dashboard. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Users. 4. Select the user for whom
      you want to enable MFA. 5. Go to the Security Credentials tab and click on Manage
      MFA. 6. Follow the prompts to enable MFA for the user.
