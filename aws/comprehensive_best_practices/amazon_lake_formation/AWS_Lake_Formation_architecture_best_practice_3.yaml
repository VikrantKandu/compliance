    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure, compromising sensitive information and potentially violating
      compliance requirements.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the permissions of each bucket to ensure that no buckets are publicly
      accessible.
    - Check the bucket policy and access control list (ACL) settings for public access.
    - Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to programmatically list and verify the public access
      status of buckets.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - If any bucket is found to be publicly accessible, modify the bucket policy and
      ACL to restrict public access.
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent future public access configurations.
    - Regularly review and audit bucket permissions to ensure compliance with security
      best practices.
