    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security groups
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Check that EC2 instances are not associated with the default security
      group. Default security groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which
      can expose instances to security risks.
    Rationale: Using default security groups can lead to unintended network access
      to EC2 instances. It is recommended to create custom security groups with specific
      rules to restrict access based on need, reducing the attack surface.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    - Select "Instances" and review the security groups associated with each instance.
    - Verify that no instances are using the default security group.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances can be launched with the default security
      group, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
    Remediation:
    - Identify instances using the default security group.
    - Create a new security group with specific inbound and outbound rules tailored
      to the instance's requirements.
    - Apply the new security group to the instance and remove the default security
      group.
