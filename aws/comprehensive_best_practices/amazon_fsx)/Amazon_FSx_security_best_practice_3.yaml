    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Publicly accessible buckets
      can expose data to the internet, leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: By ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible, you reduce the
      risk of data exposure and unauthorized access. Public access to buckets can
      lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Public access settings" to ensure that public access
      is blocked.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> to verify
      that the ACL does not allow public access.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> to
      ensure that the bucket policy does not grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service and select the bucket.
    - Click on "Permissions" and ensure that all public access is blocked.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
    - Use the AWS CLI to update bucket settings if necessary.
