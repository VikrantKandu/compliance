    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide
      two or more verification factors to gain access, enhancing security by making
      it more difficult for unauthorized users to access the account.
    Rationale: The root account has unrestricted access to all resources in an AWS
      account. Without MFA, if the root account credentials are compromised, it could
      lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse of resources, data breaches,
      and financial loss.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - Check the 'Security Credentials' section for the root account.
    - Verify that 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)' is enabled.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console with root credentials.
    - Navigate to the 'My Security Credentials' page.
    - Under 'Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)', select 'Activate MFA'.
    - Follow the instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or hardware MFA device.
    - Ensure the MFA device is successfully configured and activated.
