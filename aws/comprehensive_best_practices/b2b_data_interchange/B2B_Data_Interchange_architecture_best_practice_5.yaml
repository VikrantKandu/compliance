    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that MFA is enabled for all IAM users to provide an additional
      layer of security for accessing AWS resources. MFA requires users to provide
      a second factor of authentication, such as a code from a mobile app, in addition
      to their password.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
      to AWS resources. Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker
      can gain full access to the user's permissions. MFA helps mitigate this risk
      by requiring additional authentication.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - For each user, check the 'MFA' column to verify that MFA is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, MFA is not enabled for IAM users.
    Remediation:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' from the navigation pane.
    - Click on the specific user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Under the 'Security credentials' tab, click 'Manage' under 'Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA)'.
    - Follow the prompts to assign and activate an MFA device for the user.
