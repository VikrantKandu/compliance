    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data exposure, which can
      result in data breaches and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions and ensure that the bucket is not publicly
      accessible.
    - Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not allow public
      access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
    Remediation:
    - Remove any public access permissions from the bucket policy and ACL.
    - Use the S3 Block Public Access feature to prevent public access.
    - Regularly review bucket permissions and adjust as necessary to maintain compliance.
