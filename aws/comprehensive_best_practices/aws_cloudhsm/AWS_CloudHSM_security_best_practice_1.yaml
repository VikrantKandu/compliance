    Title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
      on top of a username and password. Enabling MFA for all IAM users helps protect
      user credentials and prevents unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Without MFA, if a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain
      complete access to that user's AWS resources. MFA significantly reduces the
      risk of unauthorized access by requiring a second form of verification.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, select 'Users'.
    - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by verifying the 'MFA' column.
    - Alternatively, use the AWS CLI command aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices to list
      all users and their MFA status.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users are not required to have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Select the user for whom you want to enable MFA.
    - Choose 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Multi-factor authentication', select 'Manage'.
    - Follow the wizard to enable and configure MFA for the user.
