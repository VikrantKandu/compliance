    Title: Ensure IAM Policies are Attached Only to Groups or Roles
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that IAM policies are not directly attached to
      individual users, but rather to groups or roles. This approach simplifies policy
      management and enhances security by ensuring users inherit permissions through
      group or role memberships.
    Rationale: Attaching policies directly to users can lead to complex permission
      structures that are difficult to manage and audit. It increases the risk of
      privilege creep and makes it harder to enforce the principle of least privilege.
      By attaching policies to groups or roles, permissions can be managed more efficiently
      and securely.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - Review the list of IAM users and check for any policies directly attached to
      users.
    - Verify that all policies are attached to groups or roles instead of individual
      users.
    Default Value: By default, AWS allows attaching policies directly to users, groups,
      or roles.
    Remediation:
    - Detach any policies directly attached to users.
    - Create or identify appropriate groups or roles for the users.
    - Attach the necessary policies to these groups or roles.
    - Add users to the groups or assign them the roles to ensure they have the required
      permissions.
