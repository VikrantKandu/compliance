    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM Users
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to add an additional layer of
      security. MFA requires users to provide a second form of authentication, which
      enhances the protection of AWS accounts against unauthorized access.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access by
      requiring additional verification beyond just a password. Without MFA, accounts
      are more vulnerable to phishing attacks and credential theft, which could lead
      to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
    - Select 'Users' and review each user to check if MFA is enabled.
    - Verify that all users have MFA devices assigned and activated.
    Default Value: By default, IAM users do not have MFA enabled.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select 'Users'.
    - For each user, click on 'Security credentials'.
    - Under 'Assigned MFA device', click 'Manage' and follow the steps to assign and
      activate an MFA device for the user.
