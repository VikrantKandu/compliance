    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Verify that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access to sensitive data. This involves checking bucket policies and access
      control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not grant public access.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure, resulting in compliance violations and reputational damage. Ensuring
      buckets are private protects sensitive data and aligns with security best practices.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Review the bucket list and identify buckets with public access indicators.
    - For each bucket, check the bucket policy and ACL settings.
    - Verify that no policies or ACLs grant public access.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Access the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket with public access.
    - Modify the bucket policy to remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Adjust the ACL to ensure no public access permissions are granted.
    - Alternatively, use AWS CLI or SDKs to update bucket policies and ACLs programmatically.
