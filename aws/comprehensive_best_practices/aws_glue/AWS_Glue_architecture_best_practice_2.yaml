    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
      to prevent unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to deny
      public access unless explicitly required for a specific use case.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to unintended data exposure,
      potentially causing data breaches or leaks of sensitive information. Ensuring
      that buckets are not publicly accessible reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Verify that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they do not
      allow public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to remove any public access permissions.
