    Title: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Root Account
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the
      AWS root account to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to present
      two or more separate pieces of evidence to authenticate, which enhances the
      security of the account.
    Rationale: Enabling MFA on the root account helps prevent unauthorized access.
      If the root account credentials are compromised, an attacker would still need
      access to the MFA device to gain control, significantly reducing the risk of
      account takeover.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
    - Select "Users" and then "Security credentials" for the root account.
    - Verify that MFA is enabled by checking the status under the "Multi-Factor Authentication
      (MFA)" section.
    Default Value: MFA is not enabled by default for the AWS root account.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
    - Go to the "My Security Credentials" page.
    - In the "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)" section, choose "Activate MFA."
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up a virtual MFA device or a hardware
      MFA device.
