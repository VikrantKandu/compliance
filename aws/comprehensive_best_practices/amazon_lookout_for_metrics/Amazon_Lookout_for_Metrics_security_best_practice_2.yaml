    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access.
      Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users,
      leading to potential data breaches.
    Rationale: S3 buckets should not be publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized
      access and data leakage. Public access can lead to exposure of sensitive data
      and compliance violations.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Ensure that the "Block all public access" option is enabled.
    - Use the AWS CLI command aws s3api get-bucket-acl to programmatically check the
      ACL configurations for each bucket.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are private and do not allow public access.
    Remediation:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
    - Enable "Block all public access" in the "Block Public Access" settings.
    - Save changes to ensure the bucket is not publicly accessible.
