    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets do not allow public access, which
      can lead to unauthorized data exposure. S3 buckets should be configured to restrict
      access to only those who need it.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      access to sensitive information. Ensuring that buckets are not publicly accessible
      mitigates security risks and protects data integrity.
    Audit:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the S3 service.
    - For each bucket, check the permissions tab.
    - Ensure that the bucket policy does not include statements allowing public access.
    - Verify that the "Block all public access" setting is enabled.
    Default Value: By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible unless explicitly
      configured otherwise.
    Remediation:
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select the bucket to be modified.
    - Go to the permissions tab and review the bucket policy.
    - Remove any statements that allow public access.
    - Enable the "Block all public access" setting and save changes.
