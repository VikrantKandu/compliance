    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible by
      default. Public access to S3 buckets can lead to data exposure and unauthorized
      access.
    Rationale: Preventing public access to S3 buckets helps protect sensitive data
      from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to data leaks
      and compliance issues.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Ensure that 'Block all public access' settings are enabled.
    Default Value: By default, new buckets have public access blocked.
    Remediation:
    - Step 1: Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select the bucket that is publicly accessible.
    - Step 4: Go to the 'Permissions' tab and enable 'Block all public access'.
    - Step 5: Review bucket policies and remove any statements that allow public access.
