    Title: Ensure EC2 instances are not using default security group
    Profile Applicability: Level 1, Level 2
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are not associated with
      the default security group. The default security group allows unrestricted inbound
      and outbound traffic, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
    Rationale: Using the default security group poses a security risk as it allows
      all inbound and outbound traffic. This can lead to unauthorized access to the
      EC2 instances and potential data breaches. It is recommended to create custom
      security groups with specific rules to control traffic.
    Audit:
    - Log into the AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Select 'Instances' from the sidebar.
    - For each instance, check the associated security groups.
    - Verify that the default security group is not associated with any instance.
    Default Value: By default, EC2 instances may be associated with the default security
      group.
    Remediation:
    - Identify EC2 instances associated with the default security group.
    - Create a custom security group with specific inbound and outbound rules.
    - Detach the default security group from the instances and attach the custom security
      group.
