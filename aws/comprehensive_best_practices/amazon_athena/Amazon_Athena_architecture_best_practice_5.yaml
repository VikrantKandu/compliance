    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are Private
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that all Amazon S3 buckets are configured to be
      private, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
      data exposure. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates the risk of sensitive
      information being accessed by unauthorized users.
    Audit: Use the AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets and check their access permissions.
      Look for any buckets with public access settings and verify the bucket policies
      and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure they are not publicly accessible.
    Default Value: By default, newly created S3 buckets are private.
    Remediation: If a bucket is found to be public, modify the bucket policy and ACL
      to restrict access. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to set the bucket
      to private and configure specific access permissions as needed.
