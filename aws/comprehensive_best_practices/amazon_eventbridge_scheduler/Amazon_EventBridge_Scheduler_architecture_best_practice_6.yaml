    Title: Ensure S3 Buckets are not publicly accessible
    Profile Applicability: Level 1
    Description: This check ensures that Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public access,
      which can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
    Rationale: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet,
      leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are private
      mitigates these risks.
    Audit:
    - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    - Step 2: Navigate to the S3 service.
    - Step 3: Select each bucket and review the 'Permissions' tab.
    - Step 4: Check the 'Block public access' settings and ensure that all options
        are enabled.
    - Step 5: Verify that bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) do not grant
        public access.
    Default Value: By default, new S3 buckets block all public access.
    Remediation:
    - Action 1: Enable 'Block public access' settings for the bucket in the S3 console.
    - Action 2: Review and modify bucket policies and ACLs to ensure no public access
        is granted.
    - Action 3: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to restrict access to
        authorized users only.
